.. index:: Actions; SellUnit super weapon no longer causes IEs with Tank Bunker.

=============================
:captiontag:`Action=SellUnit`
=============================

In :game:`Tiberian Sun` you could sell units that were docked with a structure
by using the normal Sell button on the sidebar. In :game:`Yuri's Revenge`, a
super weapon with :tag:`Action=SellUnit` achieves the same function. However, if
such a super weapon were fired on a unit inside a Tank Bunker then an Internal
Error would occur (sometimes this would be delayed until the destruction of the
Tank Bunker). :game:`Ares` prevents the error occurring.
