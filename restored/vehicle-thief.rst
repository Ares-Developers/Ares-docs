.. index:: Infantry; VehicleThief logic without workarounds

=============
Vehicle Thief
=============

With :game:`Ares` you can create vehicle thieves like the Mutant Hijacker from
:game:`Tiberian Sun` without having to use :tag:`Thief=yes`,
:tag:`Infiltrate=yes` or :tag:`Agent=yes` also. The logic was amended to allow
for some customization the original game didn't support.

See the :doc:`/new/hijackers` section for details.
