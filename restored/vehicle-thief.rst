Vehicle Thief
=============
With Ares you can create vehicle thieves like the Mutant Hijacker from
Tiberian Sun without having to use :command:`Thief=yes`, :command:`Infiltrate=yes`
or :command:`Agent=yes` also. The logic was amended to allow for some
customization the original game didn't support.<br>
