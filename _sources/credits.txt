Special Thanks

Westwood Studios
	For creating this great game in the first place. Although you guys
	really should've fired half of your coding staff (out of a cannon,
	into the sun).
Marshall
	For developing Launch Base and the YR Unofficial 1.002
	Mini-Patch (UMP), and whipping the documentation into shape.
Renegade
	For providing the infrastructure for the Ares website and the unstable
	development builds page.
eva-251
	For researching and providing the proper Comodo Internet Security settings for
	Syringe/Ares.

Testers

The developers would like to express their gratitude to all those who invested
time and effort to help improve Ares by testing it, suffering through
countless bugs, exceptions and menial tasks in the process.

Without them, we could not have reached the standard of quality we have reached
today.

Though we had many testers over the years, some have distinguished themselves
through exceptional effort, high testing quality and commendable dedication:
