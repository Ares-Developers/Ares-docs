Ares Documentation


Introduction

Ares is the new tool to extend the capabilities of Yuri's
Revenge and to fix bugs in the game engine. It was conceived by pd near the end
of 2007, developed over the years by The Ares Contributors and
first released to the public in 2010.

This documentation is aimed primarily at mod authors wishing to make use of the
new functionality that Ares offers.

Ares is incorporated into Yuri's Revenge via the use of
Syringe, a program initially developed by pd to 'inject' DLL code into a
running executable without modifying the executable file itself.

In this case, the Ares DLL is injected into the Yuri's Revenge
1.001 main executable, gamemd.exe. The properly patched original CD
version as well as the compilations The First Decade and The
Ultimate Collection are supported.

Syringe can be run directly via a command line prompt or automatically
run from external launcher applications provided by a mod. See the respective
documentations of those programs for further details.
