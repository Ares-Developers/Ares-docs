Customizable Veterancy


Configure the way units get experience from killing enemies.

Trainable=no is always honored, no untrainable unit will get any
experience. Mind that an open-topped vehicle in the unmodified game also could
promote its passengers (but without the mind-control check) if it had
Trainable=no set.

 Veterancy; Experience from passengers

From Passengers


[TechnoType]Experience.FromPassengers=boolean
  Allow OpenTopped=yes and Gunner=yes units to gain experience
  when a passenger kills an enemy. If this is no the unit only gets
  promoted when killing enemies itself. For gunners like the IFV this means the
  vehicle may not have any passengers to gain experience. Defaults to
  yes.
[TechnoType]Experience.PromotePassengers=boolean
  If an OpenTopped=yes or Gunner=yes unit is trainable and already
  elite,  the passenger shooting will get the experience instead. If this is
  no the additional experience will be lost as the vehicle is elite
  already. Defaults to no.
[TechnoType]Experience.PassengerModifier=float - multiplier
  If a kill gets credited to a passenger, the experience gain is multiplied by
  this value. Defaults to 100%.



  Veterancy; Experience from airstrikes
  Airstrikes; Give experience to designator

From Airstrikes


[TechnoType]Experience.FromAirstrike=boolean
  If a kill gets credited to an aircraft that was called in by an air strike,
  the designator will get the experience instead of the actual aircraft.
  Defaults to no.
[TechnoType]Experience.AirstrikeModifier=float - multiplier
  If Experience.FromAircraft=yes is set on the designator of an airstrike
  (like Boris), the experience gain is multiplied by this value. Defaults to
  100%.



  Veterancy; Experience from mind control
  Mind Control; Give experience to mind-controller

From Mind-Controlled


[TechnoType]Experience.MindControlSelfModifier=float - multiplier
  If a mind-controlled unit kills an enemy, its controller gets this percentage
  of the experience the original killer can get (the amount before
  Experience.MindControlVictimModifier is applied). This additional
  experience is not subtracted from the experience gained by the original
  killer. Defaults to 0%.
[TechnoType]Experience.MindControlVictimModifier=float - multiplier
  If a mind-controlled unit kills an enemy, its gained experience is multiplied
  by this value. Use this for example to subtract the amount the unit's
  controller gets by having this value and
  Experience.MindControlSelfModifier sum up to 100%. Defaults to
  100%.

Mind-controlled open-topped vehicles will not gain any experience from their
passengers if the mind-controller's and the open-topped's players aren't allied.
Mind-controllers will not gain experience from killing enemies with a captured
allied unit.



  Veterancy; Experience from spawns
  Spawns; Give experience to spawners

From Spawns


Spawners like the Aircraft Carrier or the Destroyer can get experience from
their spawned aircrafts' kills. For this to work, both the spawn and the spawner
must be Trainable=yes. The following two tags go on the unit that spawns,
not the spawns themselves.

[TechnoType]Experience.SpawnOwnerModifier=float - multiplier
  The percentage of experience the unit owning a spawn gains when the spawn
  kills an enemy. This tag has to be set on the spawner unit, not the spawn.
  Defaults to 0%.
[TechnoType]Experience.SpawnModifier=float - multiplier
  The percentage of experience a spawn of this unit gains when the spawn kills
  an enemy. This tag has to be set on the spawner unit, not the spawn.
  Defaults to 100%.

To split the experience between spawner and spawns, make these values sum up to
100%. This is not required, though.

If a spawner is mind-controlled, both the spawner's and the spawn's experience
is multiplied by Experience.MindControlVictimModifier.
