 Crates; Random money amount

Crate Settings


Money crates do not only award the amounts set in the rules, but also vary the
amount randomly by 900 credits. This can be customized using this new tag.

[CrateRules]RandomCrateMoney=integer - credits
  A random money amount between 0 and this value is added on money
  crate bonuses. To make the granted money amount deterministic, set this to
  0. Defaults to 900.
