 Airstrikes; Attack and abort voices

Airstrike Voices


Ares supports custom airstrike related voices. These flags can be
defined on the designator unit like Boris and the aircraft (the designator's
flags take precedence). If a flag isn't set on any of those, the respective
[AudioVisual]â–º flag is used. To disable an airstrike voice, set it to an
empty sound.
