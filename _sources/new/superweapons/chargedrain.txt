 Super Weapons; Charge to drain ratio for each super weapon

Charge/Drain Super Weapons


Instead of one global setting, Ares supports customizable
ChargeToDrainRatio settings for each super weapon. All settings here
only apply for super weapons with UseChargeDrain=yes set.

[SuperWeapon]SW.ChargeToDrainRatio=float multiplier
  The recharge time multiplied by this value is how long the super weapon will
  stay active. Must not be 0. Defaults to
  [General]â–ºChargeToDrainRatio.
[SuperWeapon]SW.Unstoppable=boolean
  Whether this super weapon can be stopped when active. Otherwise clicks on the
  super weapon's cameo are ignored. Defaults to no.

 Note that UseChargeDrain is supported for the Firewall super
  weapon only. Using it along with any other super weapon types it will lead to
  unexpected results.
