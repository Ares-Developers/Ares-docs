Cost


The firing of a super weapon can now add or subtract credits from the firing
player's cash reserve. If the player doesn't have enough funds the launch is
aborted and an EVA event is triggered to notify the player. Super weapons
costing money will show the needed amount in the super weapon's cameo tool tip.
If the player has not enough money to use the super weapon, the sidebar cameo
is grayed out.
