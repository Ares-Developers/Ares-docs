Hardcoded Values


It made no sense to have the values PreClick, PostClick, and
PreDependent customizable. Ares hardcodes these values and they
have no effect any more. Instead, SW.PostDependent takes their place.

[SuperWeapon]SW.PostDependent=SuperWeapon
  The super weapon invoked right after firing this super weapon. As in
  Red Alert 2 the only super weapon using this is the ChronoSphere
  invoking the ChronoWarp. To distinguish between multiple of such super weapons
  you can provide the specific super weapon ID here. For example,
  [ChronoSphereSpecial]â–ºSW.PostDependent=ChronoWarpSpecial switches to the
  ChronoWarp type super weapon after you chose the source location.
