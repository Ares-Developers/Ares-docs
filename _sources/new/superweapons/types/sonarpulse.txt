 Universe; Sonar Pulse briefly reveals cloaked units

Type=SonarPulse


The Sonar Pulse is a variation of the original Sonar Pulse known from
Red Alert -- it will cause any cloaked object either in range or on the
entire map to temporarily decloak, even if it is cloaked by a Cloak Generator.

Default values for general tags:

[SuperWeapon]SW.Range=float,integer
  The radius, in cells, that the decloak effect will be applied. Use -1
  to reveal all units on the map. When using full-map sonar you don't have to
  select a target location; instead the super weapon will be fired when you
  click its cameo icon. Defaults to 10.
[SuperWeapon]SW.AITargeting=enumeration
  Defaults to Stealth.
[SuperWeapon]SW.AffectsHouse=enumeration
  Specifies the houses affected by the sonar reveal. Defaults to
  enemies.
[SuperWeapon]SW.AffectsTarget=enumeration
  Specifies which types the sonar affects. Defaults to water, all unit
  types situated on water cells.
[SuperWeapon]SW.RequiresTarget=enumeration
  Specifies where human players can fire the sonar at, which excludes land by
  default. Defaults to water.
[SuperWeapon]SW.AIRequiresTarget=enumeration
  Specifies where AI players can fire the sonar at, which excludes land by
  default. Defaults to water.

Sonar Pulse specific tags:

[SuperWeapon]SonarPulse.Delay=integer - frames
  The duration that the decloak effect will last. Defaults to 60.
