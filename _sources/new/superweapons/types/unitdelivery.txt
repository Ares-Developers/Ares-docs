Type=UnitDelivery


The Unit Delivery super weapon will create the specified unit(s) in the target
area.

  Played when the units are placed. Defaults to none.
[SuperWeapon]SW.AITargeting=enumeration
  Defaults to ParaDrop.


Unit Delivery specific tags:

[SuperWeapon]Deliver.Types=list of TechnoTypes
  The list of units that will be delivered. This works for infantry, vehicles,
  aircraft and buildings.
[SuperWeapon]Deliver.Owner=enumeration invoker|neutral|special|civilian
  The country the delivered units will belong to. invoker is the player
  who fired the super weapon, civilian is the first country of the side
  named Civilian, special is the country named
  Special and neutral is the country named Neutral.
  Defaults to invoker.


The delivery of the units happens all at once, after firing the super weapon and
awaiting its deferment.

The super weapon will try to find a location close to the target area for each
object. This process depends on many factors and also involves randomness, thus
the placement order is not fixed. Do not rely on a specific order.

All objects are placed on the ground, including aircraft. Flying units that
never land (e.g. the Rocketeer and Kirovs) will take off. Infantry squads are
grouped in a single cell.

Units owned by AI are set to go on a hunt mission, buildings are put on a guard
and human owned units are put on a guard area mission.

You can mix in naval units and they will be placed where they can normally
exist.
