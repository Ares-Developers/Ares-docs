 Super Weapons; Detonate any warhead at target cell

Type=GenericWarhead


The Generic Warhead super weapon will detonate the specified warhead at the
target cell.

Default values for general tags:

[SuperWeapon]SW.Damage=integer
  The amount of damage that will be dealt by the warhead.
[SuperWeapon]SW.Warhead=warhead
  The warhead that will be detonated when in the target cell when the super
  weapon is fired. Note the warhead is detonated in a cell, not on a unit, so
  chances are you will want to set a CellSpread on the warhead to make
  sure the desired targets (especially InfantryTypes) are affected.
[SuperWeapon]SW.AITargeting=enumeration
  Defaults to Offensive.

Don't forget that the BuildingType will need DamageSelf=yes set
(just like the Soviet Nuclear Missile Silo) if you want the warhead to be
capable of damaging the firing building.
