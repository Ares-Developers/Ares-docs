Type=ChronoSphere


The ChronoSphere type super weapon needs a ChronoWarp type
super weapon. If you have more than one ChronoSphere super weapons, you
can reuse the same ChronoWarp super weapon for all of them, or create
dedicated super weapons if you want to. See SW.PostDependent.

Default values for general tags:

[SuperWeapon]SW.Range=float,integer
  Range affected by the chronoshift. Defaults to 3,3.
[SuperWeapon]SW.Animation=Animation
  The placement animation indicating the source location for the chronoshift.
  Defaults to [General]►ChronoPlacement.
[SuperWeapon]SW.AnimationHeight=integer
  The height the SW.Animation is played above the ground. Defaults to
  5.
[SuperWeapon]SW.AITargeting=enumeration
  Defaults to none. The AI cannot use this.
[SuperWeapon]SW.AffectsHouse=enumeration
  Specifies the houses affected by the chronoshift. Defaults to all.
[SuperWeapon]SW.AffectsTarget=enumeration
  Specifies which types the chronoshift affects. Defaults to
  infantry,units.
  
   Please note that buildings with Chronoshift.IsVehicle=yes are
    considered units and not buildings, if
    Chronosphere.ReconsiderBuildings=yes is set.
[SuperWeapon]SW.PostDependent=super weapon
  Specifies the super weapon used to select the target cell for the chronoshift
  by ID. Defaults to the first ChronoWarp type super weapon in the
  SuperWeaponTypes list.
[SuperWeapon]Cursor=mouse cursor
  Defaults to Chronosphere.


Chronosphere specific tags:

[SuperWeapon]Chronosphere.BlastSrc=Animation
  The Animation played above the source when the chronoshift is started.
  Defaults to [General]►ChronoBlast.
[SuperWeapon]Chronosphere.BlastDest=Animation
  The Animation played above the destination when the chronoshift is started.
  Defaults to [General]►ChronoBlastDest.
[SuperWeapon]Chronosphere.ReconsiderBuildings=boolean
  Defines whether the chronoshift will consider buildings with
  Chronoshift.IsVehicle=yes as vehicles instead. Otherwise
  deployed-vehicle type buildings always count as buildings like with the
  original Chronosphere. Defaults to yes.
[SuperWeapon]Chronosphere.KillOrganic=boolean
  Defines whether the chronoshift will kill all organic units. Otherwise the
  units will not be killed by the chronoshift and teleport instead. Defaults to
  yes.
[SuperWeapon]Chronosphere.KillTeleporters=boolean
  Defines whether the chronoshift will kill units with Teleporter=yes
  set. Otherwise the units will be chronoshifted. Defaults to no.
[SuperWeapon]Chronosphere.AffectsIronCurtain=boolean
  Defines whether the chronoshift will affect iron curtained units. Otherwise
  the units will be ignored. Defaults to no.
[SuperWeapon]Chronosphere.AffectsUnwarpable=boolean
  Defines whether the chronoshift will affect units with Warpable=no set.
  Otherwise the units will be ignored. Defaults to yes.
[SuperWeapon]Chronosphere.AffectsUndeployable=boolean
  Defines whether the chronoshift will affect buildings that can be undeployed
  into units again. Effectively, if a building has UndeploysInto= set and
  this value is yes, SW.AffectsTarget and
  Chronoshift.IsVehicle are bypassed and the building is chronoshifted
  with vehicle placement rules. Defaults to no.

   "Undeployable" means *buildings that can undeploy*, rather than
    *vehicles that cannot deploy*.

[SuperWeapon]Chronosphere.BlowUnplaceable=boolean
  Defines whether the chronoshift will destroy buildings that don't fit in the
  target location, otherwise the buildings will stay at the source location.
  This function will not spare units that have been deployed into buildings.
  Defaults to yes.
[SuperWeapon]Chronosphere.KillCargo=boolean
  Whether all passengers and occupants should be killed when the object is
  chronshifted. Defaults to no.


Other changes:

It is now possible to chronoshift buildings. Note that there is a difference to
chronoporting units: If a building cannot be placed in the target location it
will blow up in the source location (if the default
Chronosphere.BlowUnplaceable=yes is used). Vehicle-type buildings will
try to find a fitting place just like units would.

See Chronoshift to prevent objects from being
chronoshifted.

 There are several known issues with chronoshifting buildings that
  haven't been fixed yet. For example, buildup animations will restart and the
  turret facing is reset.

Type=ChronoWarp


The ChronoWarp type super weapon is fired at the target location of the
chronoshift and marks the position the units will be teleported to. If you have
a ChronoSphere type super weapon you have to have one
ChronoWarp type super weapon, too.

From the ChronoWarp type super weapon only the targeting and cursor
properties are used, as well as Range to indicate the area of effect by
drawing radial lines around the cursor. SW.Range is not used.

For the actual chronoshifting tags, see ChronoSphere.

Default values for general tags:

[SuperWeapon]SW.AITargeting=enumeration
  Defaults to none. The AI cannot use this.
[SuperWeapon]Cursor=mouse cursor
  Defaults to Chronosphere.
