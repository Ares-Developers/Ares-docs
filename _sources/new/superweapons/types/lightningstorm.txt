Default values for general tags:

[SuperWeapon]SW.Range=float,integer

[SuperWeapon]SW.Damage=integer
  The damage each lightning bolt delivers. Defaults to
  [General]►LightningDamage.
[SuperWeapon]SW.Warhead=Warhead

Lightning Storm specific tags:

[SuperWeapon]Lightning.Duration=integer - frames
  The length the Lightning Storm endures. A value of -1 means
  indefinite duration. Defaults to [General]►LightningStormDuration.
[SuperWeapon]Lightning.RadarOutage=integer - frames
  The number of frames radars are jammed for players defined by
  SW.AffectsHouse. Defaults to [General]►LightningStormDuration.
[SuperWeapon]Lightning.RadarOutageAffects=enumeration
  Specifies the houses affected by radar outage. Defaults to enemies.
[SuperWeapon]Lightning.HitDelay=integer - frames
  The number of frames between two clouds being created over the target cell.
  Values of 0 or lower will disable direct hits. Clouds created by this
  mechanism are never subject to separation rules (see below). Defaults to
  [General]►LightningHitDelay.
[SuperWeapon]Lightning.ScatterDelay=integer - frames
  The number of frames between clouds getting created over a random cell in the
  super weapon's range. Values of 0 or lower will disable random hits. Only
  clouds created by this mechanism are subject to separation rules (see below).
  Defaults to [General]►LightningScatterDelay.
[SuperWeapon]Lightning.ScatterCount=integer
  The number of new clouds created every Lightning.ScatterDelay frames.
  Values of 0 or lower will disable random hits. Defaults to 1.
[SuperWeapon]Lightning.Separation=integer - distance
  The least number of cells between two random clouds to better distribute
  damage. This is not the direct distance, but rather the sum of the differences
  of the x and y components. Values of 0 or lower will disable separation rules.
  Defaults to [General]►LightningSeparation.
[SuperWeapon]Lightning.PrintText=boolean
  Enables the warning text appearing shortly before the Lightning Storm strikes.
  Defaults to [General]►LightningPrintText.
[SuperWeapon]Lightning.IgnoreLightningRod=boolean
  Disables the special handling for buildings with LightningRod=yes set.
  Defaults to no.
[SuperWeapon]Lightning.DebrisMin=integer
  The least number of debris created when lightning strikes empty cells or
  destroys a building or a unit. Defaults to 2.
[SuperWeapon]Lightning.DebrisMax=integer
  The largest number of debris created when lightning strikes empty cells or
  destroys a building or a unit. Defaults to 4.
[SuperWeapon]Lightning.CloudHeight=integer - leptons
  The height above the ground the clouds get created in. Values less than 0 will
  center the cloud image on top of the first bolt anim from the list (for the
  original game this is about 1200). Defaults to -1.
[SuperWeapon]Lightning.BoltExplosion=Animation
  Every lightning bolt will display this damage animation upon impact. Defaults
  to [General]►WeatherConBoltExplosion.
[SuperWeapon]Lightning.Sounds=list of Sounds
  A comma separated list of sounds played when lightning strikes. Defaults to
  [AudioVisual]►LightningSounds.
[SuperWeapon]Lightning.Clouds=list of Animation
  A comma separated list of cloud animations. Defaults to
  [General]►WeatherConClouds.

   If this list is empty, the Lightning Storm super weapon will
    not function. 
[SuperWeapon]Lightning.Bolts=list of Animation
  A comma separated list of bolt animations. If this list is empty, the damage
  is caused even though no bolts are shown. Defaults to
  [General]►WeatherConBolts.

   Do not use Bouncer=yes animations with
    Lightning.Bolts. This leads to crashes if a building is hit.

[SuperWeapon]Lightning.Debris=list of Animation
  A comma separated list of animations used as debris when lightning strikes.
  Defaults to [General]►MetallicDebris.
