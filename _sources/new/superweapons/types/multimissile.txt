Type=MultiMissile


Default values for general tags:

[SuperWeapon]SW.Damage=integer
  The damage the nuclear missile delivers. Negative values indicate to use the
  payload weapon's damage. Defaults to -1.
[SuperWeapon]SW.Warhead=Warhead
  The warhead used to deal the damage of the nuke. If this is empty, the payload
  weapon's warhead will be used. Defaults to none.
[SuperWeapon]SW.ActivationSound=Sound
  The nuke warn siren played at the destination. Defaults to
  [AudioVisual]►DigSound.
[SuperWeapon]SW.AITargeting=enumeration
  Defaults to Nuke.
[SuperWeapon]Light.*=integer
  Default to Light.Ambient=200, Light.Red=175,
  Light.Green=150, and Light.Blue=125 respectively.
[SuperWeapon]Cursor=mouse cursor
  Defaults to Nuke.


Nuclear missile specific tags:

[SuperWeapon]Nuke.Payload=Weapon
  The Weapon used to display the downward-pointing nuke and as default, if
  SW.Damage and SW.Warhead aren't set. Defaults to
  NukePayload.

   The weapon used as Nuke.Payload has to be put into the
    WeaponTypes section. The Weedguy hack will not work.
[SuperWeapon]Nuke.TakeOff=Animation
  The Animation played on the missile silo when the missile is launched.
  Defaults to [General]►NukeTakeOff.
[SuperWeapon]Nuke.PsiWarning=Animation
  The Animation played at the nuke target, detectable by Psychic Sensors.
  Defaults to PSIWARN.
[SuperWeapon]Nuke.SiloLaunch=boolean
  Whether this missile is launched from a building with NukeSilo=yes
  providing this super weapon. Otherwise the weapon defined by
  Nuke.Payload is created off-screen, aiming for the target cell.
  Defaults to yes.


Other changes:

Use WeaponType to control the properties of the upward flying animation
(especially its Projectile). Ares respects the WeaponType
for every nuke, it will not use the WeaponType of the first superweapon
with Type=Nuke like Yuri's Revenge did. Also mind to set
NukeMaker=yes on the WeaponType, otherwise the nuke will not come
down again.

Ares supports multiple buildings with NukeSilo=yes providing this
super weapon. Yuri's Revenge only tried to find the first building type
that matched those criteria.

Ares adds support to launch the missile and have it aim for the target
directly like in Tiberian Sun instead of going straight up from the silo
and coming down on the target. This is controlled by Vertical on the
projectile.

Yuri's Revenge supported the nuke impact animation only for the warhead
called NUKE, hardcoded to NUKEBALL. To change this animation in
Ares, have a look at PreImpactAnim.
