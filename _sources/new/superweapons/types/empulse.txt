 Universe; EMPulse cannons with limited range fired by super weapon

Type=EMPulse


This type implements the super weapon known from Tiberian Sun, with
several extensions. It makes one or more buildings, called cannons, of arbitrary
type fire at the same time at either a target location selected by the player or
at themselves.

 The AI cannot make full use of this super weapon yet, because it does
  not respect ranges, which is a fundamental feature of this super weapon type.

Default values for general tags:

[SuperWeapon]SW.RangeMinimum=float - cell range
  The minimum range below which a cannon is not eligible to fire. Set to
  negative values to use each cannon's primary weapon's minimum range. Defaults
  to 0.0, which disables the check.

[SuperWeapon]SW.RangeMaximum=float - cell range
  The maximum range above which a cannon is not eligible to fire. Set to
  negative values to use the each cannon's primary weapon's range. Defaults to
  -1.0. 

[SuperWeapon]SW.MaxCount=integer
  The maximum number of cannons firing. Set to negative values for unlimited
  cannons. Defaults to 1. 

[SuperWeapon]SW.AITargeting=enumeration
  AI does not respect ranges. For EMPulse.TargetSelf=yes super weapons,
  use NoTarget to enable AI players to use it. Defaults to
  None.

[SuperWeapon]Cursor=mouse cursor
  Used when the target is in range of a cannon. Defaults to Attack.

[SuperWeapon]NoCursor=mouse cursor
  Used when there is no cannon in range. Defaults to AttackOutOfRange.

EMPulse specific tags:

[SuperWeapon]EMPulse.Cannons=list of BuildingType
  The building types considered to check the range and to fire. If the list is
  empty, all buildings with EMPulseCannon=yes are considered. All
  buildings are required to have a primary weapon. Defaults to none.

[SuperWeapon]EMPulse.TargetSelf=boolean
  Whether each cannon to fire should fire its primary weapon at itself. The
  cannon does not actually fire; the weapon just detonates once on the cannon
  building immediately, similar to a death weapon. To actually damage itself,
  the building needs to have DamageSelf=yes set. Defaults to no.

[SuperWeapon]EMPulse.Linked=boolean
  Whether only one cannon needs to satisfy the range checks to the target. All
  other cannons will then be considered regardless of range. Only makes sense if
  SW.MaxCount has a value other than 1. The difference to just
  making the cannon itself a designator is that the cannon can be made to not
  provide fire clearance on their own. Defaults to no.

[SuperWeapon]EMPulse.PulseBall=Animation
  The optional animation played at the FLH at the beginning of the delay before
  the cannon fires. Use none to disable the pulse ball. This does not
  disable the delay. Defaults to PULSBALL.

[SuperWeapon]EMPulse.PulseDelay=integer - frames
  The delay before firing, but after the cannon rotated towards the target and
  started the EMPulse.PulseBall animation. Defaults to 32.

There are three firing modes opposed to the one known from Tiberian Sun.
Buildings with EMPulseCannon=yes rotate their turret and then create a
single bullet using the primary weapon that is thrown at the target. The
building does not actually fire and several weapon and building effects are not
respected that apply when the building is on a regular attack mission.

If EMPulse.TargetSelf=yes, a single bullet is immediately detonated at
each firing cannon's location. Again, the building does not actually fire.

If a building with EMPulseCannon=no is put into EMPulse.Cannons,
the building will fire its primary weapon at the target directly, but without
charging or turret rotation, and without any further range checks. Thus, turrets
are not supported, and buildings are not guaranteed to fire at all if they
didn't rotate in the right direction before the super weapon is fired.

Other changes:

The pulse ball animation that was previously hardcoded to PULSBALL has
now been made customizable and optional. If an EMPulseCannon=yes building
had a primary weapon without any valid Report set, the game would crash.
This does not happen anymore.
