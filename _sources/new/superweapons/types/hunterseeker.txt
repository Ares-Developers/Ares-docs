  the Hunter Seeker. If no, non-civilian targets are preferred for

  a random target is chosen. Defaults to no.


Launches up to [SuperWeapon]►SW.MaxCount Hunter Seekers of the specified
type from the firing player's buildings that are valid launch sites. Only one
Hunter Seeker is launched per building.

Hunter Seekers might pick other targets while in flight. They will not target
objects under the effect of the Iron Curtain or objects currently being warped
out of time.

valid Hunter Seeker unit and how to prevent certain TechnoTypes to be
targeted. See Sides & Countries on how to define a
default Hunter Seeker unit for each side.
