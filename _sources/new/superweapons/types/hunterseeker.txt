Hunter Seeker specific tags:

[SuperWeapon]HunterSeeker.Buildings=list of BuildingType

  of each players' side default. Defaults to the side's HunterSeeker.
[SuperWeapon]HunterSeeker.RandomOnly=boolean
  Whether every enemy object on the map has an equal chance of being targeted by
  the Hunter Seeker. If no, non-civilian targets are preferred for
  human players in multiplayer games, and only if no preferred target is found,
  a random target is chosen. Defaults to no.


Launches up to [SuperWeapon]►SW.MaxCount Hunter Seekers of the specified
type from the firing player's buildings that are valid launch sites. Only one
Hunter Seeker is launched per building.

Hunter Seekers might pick other targets while in flight. They will not target
objects under the effect of the Iron Curtain or objects currently being warped
out of time.

If the unit used as Hunter Seeker has Harvester=yes set, the unit will go
on a harvest mission automatically.

See Hunter Seeker for information on how to define a
valid Hunter Seeker unit and how to prevent certain TechnoTypes to be
targeted. See Sides & Countries on how to define a
default Hunter Seeker unit for each side.
