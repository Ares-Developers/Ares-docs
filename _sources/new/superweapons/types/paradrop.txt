Type=ParaDrop and Type=AmerParaDrop


Default values for general tags:

[SuperWeapon]SW.AITargeting=enumeration
  Defaults to ParaDrop.
[SuperWeapon]Cursor=mouse cursor
  Defaults to ParaDrop.


The original flags that control the units provided by the generic paradrop super
weapons (AllyParaDropInf, SovParaDropInf and
YuriParaDropInf) and the American paradrop (AmerParaDropInf) only
accept InfantryTypes. If you try to include a VehicleType via
these lists then the game will create a new InfantryType instead - with
the same parameters as the existing VehicleType - ultimately resulting
in an invisible InfantryType being delivered in the paradrop.

With Ares, there are new country-specific flags that override the old
flags and enhance the way paradrops are delivered. ParaDrop.Types will
accept VehicleTypes as well as InfantryTypes. You can send
multiple airplanes of user-defined type.

Each plane consists of the following properties:

[SuperWeapon]ParaDrop.Types=list of InfantryTypes and/or VehicleTypes
  The units that will be paradropped by this super weapon. For
  Type=AmerParaDrop super weapons, this defaults to
  AmerParaDropInf=.

   The original flags used to control the paradrop units only accept
    InfantryTypes. To include VehicleTypes in a paradrop you
    must use the new ParaDrop.Types and ParaDrop.Num flags.

[SuperWeapon]ParaDrop.Num=list of integers
  The quantity of each corresponding unit (listed against ParaDrop.Types)
  that will be paradropped. For Type=AmerParaDrop super weapons, this
  defaults to AmerParaDropNum=.
[SuperWeapon]ParaDrop.Aircraft=AircraftType
  The type of aircraft that will deliver the units. Defaults to the
  corresponding country's ParaDrop.Aircraft=.
[SuperWeapon]ParaDrop.Count=integer - number of planes
  This controls how many planes should be send to drop paratroopers. Defaults to
  1.


You can define every plane for each country, side or the super weapon
separately. The syntax is as follows:

[Superweapon]ParaDrop.ID.PlaneX.*=
  *ID* is name of the country or side. *X* is a positive integer, with no
  leading zeros, starting with *2* up to `Count`. To customize the first plane
  (which will also act as the default plane), do not use the *PlaneX* segment.
  If you want to set the default properties for all sides, do not use the *ID*
  segment. The Count tags can't have a *PlaneX* segment.

The Airplane and its contents will be read separately, thus it is possible to
only define Aircraft; Types and Nums will use the default
value by going though the list until the tags are defined. This also works vice
versa.

Types and Nums have to be defined together; it is not possible to
change the number of units without restating the types.

Values are read in this order, top down. The first value found is used.

#. [Superweapon]►ParaDrop.Country.PlaneX.*= (the SW's country-specific
   plane number X)
#. [Superweapon]►ParaDrop.Side.PlaneX.*= (the SW's side-specific plane
   number X)
#. [Superweapon]►ParaDrop.PlaneX.*= (the SW's default plane number X)
#. [Superweapon]►ParaDrop.Country.*= (the SW's country-specific default
   plane)
#. [Superweapon]►ParaDrop.Side.*= (the SW's side-specific default plane)
#. [Superweapon]►ParaDrop.*= (the SW's default plane)
#. [Country]►ParaDrop.*= (the country-specific default plane)
#. [Side]►ParaDrop.*= (the side-specific default plane)
#. [General]►*= (the Rules' default plane)

Examples:

+ [Superweapon]►ParaDrop.Russia.Plane3.Types=BORIS (and proper
  Nums) would replace the contents of the third plane for the country
  Russia.

+ [Superweapon]►ParaDrop.Nod.Aircraft=SPLANE would replace the aircraft
  for all Soviet side countries.

 \ To give all countries the same items, use
  [Superweapon]►ParaDrop.Count=, [Superweapon]►ParaDrop.Aircraft=,
  [Superweapon]►ParaDrop.Types=, and [Superweapon]►ParaDrop.Num=.
  This creates a clone of the American Paradrop.

You can create unlimited new paradrop superweapons with different properties.
Type=ParaDrop and Type=AmerParaDrop are treated equally, but they
differ by the default values. The AI will use both types as in the unmodified
game.
