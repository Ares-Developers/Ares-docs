Range Limits


There are two ways to restrict the targets a super weapon can fire at by range.
One is the distance to the building firing the super weapon at the target, the
second is the distance of a certain unit to the target area, which is called a
designator.

 Super Weapons; Limit minimum and maximum firing range

Range around Launch Site


Two tags define the range a super weapon can fire in: the maximum range the
target can be away from the super weapon building, and the minimum range, below
which the super weapon cannot fire.

A super weapon can fire at a location, if at least one building providing this
super weapon satisfies both range requirements. If not, the NoCursor is
shown.

[SuperWeapon]SW.RangeMaximum=float - cell range
  Distance in cells the target coordinates may be away from a player's building
  providing this super weapon. Values below 0.0 mean type-specific
  default, which usually disables this range check. Defaults to -1.0.

[SuperWeapon]SW.RangeMinimum=float - cell range
  Distance in cells the target coordinates must be away from a player's building
  providing this super weapon. Values below 0.0 mean type-specific
  default, which usually disables this range check. Defaults to -1.0.

 Super Weapons; Designators providing targets around themselves

Designators


A designator is a unit or structure that does the reconnaissance and provides a
targeting area around itself. A super weapon requiring a designator can only
fire at a location if at least one designator is in range. If no designator is
in range, the NoCursor is shown.

[SuperWeapon]SW.Designators=list of TechnoTypes
  List of units and structures eligible for designating the target location. An
  empty list requires no designator. Defaults to none.

[SuperWeapon]SW.AnyDesignator=boolean
  Whether any unit or structure is considered a valid designator for this super
  weapon. Overrides SW.Designators. Defaults to no.

The designator range can be customized for each TechnoType individually.

[TechnoType]DesignatorRange=integer - cells
  Range in cells around the unit or structure that becomes targetable by super
  weapons requiring this object as designator. Defaults to
  [TechnoType]►Sight.

 Super Weapons; Inhibitors disallow targeting around themselves

Inhibitors


In a sense, inhibitors are double negative designators: All enemy units and
structures are checked instead of player owned ones, and they disallow firing a
super weapon around them instead of being a requirement. In a positive sense,
inhibitors protect a player from enemy super weapons.

If at least one enemy inhibitor is in range, the NoCursor is shown to a
player and the super weapon cannot fire.

Buildings only inhibit firing a super weapon when they are online, that is when
there is sufficient power for them to function or they are overpowered, and they
suffice the NeedsEngineer requirement.

[SuperWeapon]SW.Inhibitors=list of TechnoTypes
  List of units and structures preventing this super weapon from firing close to
  any of them. An empty list means no inhibitors. Defaults to none.

[SuperWeapon]SW.AnyInhibitor=boolean
  Whether any unit or structure is considered a valid inhibitor for this super
  weapon. Overrides SW.Inhibitors. Defaults to no.

The inhibitor range can be customized for each TechnoType individually.

[TechnoType]InhibitorRange=integer - cells
  Range in cells around the unit or structure that becomes untargetable by super
  weapons having this object set as inhibitor. Defaults to
  [TechnoType]►Sight.
