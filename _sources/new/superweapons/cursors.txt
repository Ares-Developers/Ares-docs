Cursors


Ares allows you to specify custom mouse cursors for the super weapon,
using the following flags:

[SuperWeapon]Cursor.Frame=integer
  Starting frame of the cursor from \ mouse.sha. Defaults to the Attack
  cursor.
[SuperWeapon]Cursor.Count=integer
  Number of frames in the animated cursor.
[SuperWeapon]Cursor.Interval=integer
  How often to animate the cursor? Default is 5.
[SuperWeapon]Cursor.MiniFrame=integer
  Same as Cursor.Frame, except this is for the mouse cursor when
  positioned on the minimap. Set this to -1 to disable the minimap
  cursor and to only allow players to click on the battlefield.
[SuperWeapon]Cursor.MiniCount=integer
  Same as Cursor.Count, except this is for the mouse cursor when
  positioned on the minimap.
[SuperWeapon]Cursor.HotSpot=HotSpot X, HotSpot Y
  Specifies the coordinates on the cursor that are considered to be the 'tip'
  that is, the point from which the click event will handled. HotSpot X should
  be one of Left, Center or Right. HotSpot Y should
  be one of Top, Middle or Bottom. For example,
  Cursor.HotSpot=Left,Top will treat the top-left corner of the cursor as
  the tip. Default is Center,Middle.


All of the above Cursor.* flags have a corresponding NoCursor.*
flag, which allows you to specify the cursor that will be displayed when the
mouse pointer is positioned over a point where the super weapon cannot be fired
(e.g. the Force Shield cannot be fired over empty ground, so will display an
alternate cursor to indicate this).

The NoCursor.* flags default to the same value as their Cursor.*
counterparts.
