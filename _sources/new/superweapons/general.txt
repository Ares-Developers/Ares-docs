General properties


[SuperWeapon]SW.Range=float,integer
  Most superweapons having a ranged effect can take a float or two integers. One
  float is taken as radius around the target cell, two integers separated by
  comma denote a rectangular area. For example, SW.Range=3.5 defines a
  circle with 7 cells diameter, SW.Range=4,6 defines a rectangle 4 cells
  wide and 6 cells high. The range is no longer bound to cell spread's
  limitation of a maximum range of 10.
[SuperWeapon]SW.CreateRadarEvent=boolean
  Creates a radar event rectangle for every player centered above the super
  weapon's target cell.
[SuperWeapon]SW.AffectsHouse=enumeration none|owner|allies|team|enemies|all
  Which houses items are affected by this super weapon. You can combine multiple
  values by comma. team equals owner,allies, all
  equals owner,allies,enemies. Defaults to team for the Force
  Shield, to all otherwise.
[SuperWeapon]SW.AffectsTarget=enumeration none|land|water|empty|infantry|units|buildings
  Which items are allowed to be affected by this super weapon. You can combine
  multiple values by comma. If you don't specify either land or water, both will
  be allowed. If you don't specify any of the other values, everything can be
  affected. Thus, if you specify no restriction (none), all targets are
  valid. For example, SW.AffectsTarget=land,buildings affects all
  buildings that aren't water-bound, SW.AffectsTarget=water affects every
  water cell, occupied or empty.

  weapons support deferment.
