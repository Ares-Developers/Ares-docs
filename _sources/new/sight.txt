Sight


Sight was using a lookup table almost like CellSpread, thus it was
limited to a maximum value of 10. Ares increases this and now larger
values can be used.

 For performance reasons, Sight values larger than 10 should
  be used judiciously. It is not designed for full map reveal.

 Using larger Sight values will result in a distinct octagonal
  shaped field of view. That is how CellSpread logic works and thus no
  bug. The logic used for Sight values larger than 10 might change in the
  future.

 Sight; Values larger than 10 are possible.
