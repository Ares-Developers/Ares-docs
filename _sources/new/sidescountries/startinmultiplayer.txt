 Multiplayer; Cost for one "unit" for calculating starting units

Fixed Global Unit Cost


By default, the game will determine the average cost of a unit by summing up and
averaging all costs of units that could be used as starting units (only
considering countries that are in the current match). The Unit Count setting is
multiplied by this.

[General]StartInMultiplayerUnitCost=integer - credits
  The fixed amount of credits for one average unit. If not set, the game will
  use the method described above. In this case, Ares will now output the
  inferred average unit cost into the log file.

  Construction Yards; Start with one in multiplayer games

Pre-Deployed MCV


This allows for countries to not have an MCV at the beginning of the match, as
well as for game modes where the base locations are fixed. Also, the initial
Construction Yard could be made different from the ones obtainable later in the
game.

[Country]StartInMultiplayer.WithConst=boolean
  Whether this country shall start with the first buildable building from
  BuildConst instead of a unit from BaseUnit when starting a
  multiplayer match. Defaults to no.
