  SSCRBKMD.SHP or SYCRBKMD.SHP for sides 1, 2 and all others
  respectively.

finished the mission in under par time.

  quicker than the defined par time. Defaults to SCORE.

 Interface; Graphical text banner

Graphical Text Banner


Instead of rendering a plain text on the screen as previous titles did,
Red Alert 2 used a graphic. Here this graphic can be customized for each
side.

The shp should have at least 4 frames: campaign won and lost, and multiplayer
won and lost.

[Side]GraphicalText.Image=filename, *including* the .shp extension
  The graphic file used as overlay to show whether a mission or match has been
  won or lost. The image is centered in the viewport and rendered in the palette
  defined as GraphicalText.Palette. Defaults to GRFXTXT.SHP.

[Side]GraphicalText.Palette=filename, *including* the .pal extension
  The palette the graphical text image uses. The banner is actually rendered in
  the theater's palette and this palette is used to find the best match for the
  colors. Defaults to GRFXTXT.PAL.
