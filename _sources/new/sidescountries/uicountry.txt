Display and Selection Chance


[Country]MenuText.Status=CSF label
  Brief description of the country, displayed in the status bar of the country
  selection screen when the player mouse-overs that country in the country
  selection drop-down list.
[Country]ListIndex=integer
  Specifies which position this country should appear in the country dropdown
  list. If two or more countries use the same ListIndex, the order is
  defined by their appearance in the [Countries]► enumeration. Countries
  with negative values will not appear in the dropdown list; you can use this to
  effectively hide countries without having to change the [Countries]►
  list and thus without risking game crashes. To also prevent such countries
  from being selected randomly, set RandomSelectionWeight=0. Defaults to
  100.
[Country]RandomSelectionWeight=integer
  Specifies how likely it is that this country will be randomly selected when a
  player chooses 'Random'. The probability of this country being picked is
  calculated by dividing this country's RandomSelectionWeight value by
  the sum of all Multiplay=yes countries' RandomSelectionWeight
  values. Defaults to 1.
[Country]AIRandomSelectionWeight=integer
  The random selection weight used for AI players. This can be used to make it
  more or less likely for AI players to pick this country randomly. Defaults to
  RandomSelectionWeight.
