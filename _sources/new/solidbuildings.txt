Solid Buildings


Buildings can now be made 'solid' to projectiles, meaning that projectiles will
detonate when hitting a building rather than passing through it.

In rulesmd.ini:

[Projectile]SubjectToBuildings=boolean
  Whether or not this projectile can be blocked by solid buildings. Defaults to
  no.


In artmd.ini:

[BuildingArt]SolidHeight=integer - cells
  How tall the solid part of the building is considered to be, measured in cells
  (each cell has a height of 256 leptons), so buildings with a large amount of
  clear space near their top can allow projectiles to fly through that space.
  Negative values (e.g. -1) tell the game to consider the building's
  full Height as solid. Default is 0, meaning the building is
  not at all solid (as per the normal game).
  
   The solid building logic does not lend itself well to
    non-rectangular buildings, such as the Paris Tower or Space Needle.
  
 Buildings; Buildings can be made solid (like walls) to certain
  projectiles.
