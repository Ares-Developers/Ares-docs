Initial Payload (Troop Crawlers)


In Generals the Chinese have the Troop Crawler, a vehicle that comes
pre-filled with Red Guard infantry right from the factory. Ares adds
this feature to Yuri's Revenge.

Buildings must either have CanBeOccupied=yes or InfantryAbsorb=yes
set. Other buildings are not supported to have initial payload. Buildings are
only allowed to have InfantryType payload.

Occupiable buildings will be filled with up to MaxNumberOccupants
infantry, other buildings and units will be filled with up to Passengers
units. It's the responsibility of the modder to check Size and
SizeLimit.

InfantryType\ s cannot have initial payload.

[TechnoType]InitialPayload.Types=list of TechnoTypes
  The types of the initial payload this object is created with. Types can be
  mentioned more than once, or the corresponding InitialPayload.Nums can
  be used to repeat a type.

  BuildingType\ s and AircraftType\ s are not valid. Buildings
  are only allowed to have InfantryType payload. Types themselves having
  initial payload are not supported, because this could create infinite loops.

[TechnoType]InitialPayload.Nums=list of integers
  The optional numbers of times each type from InitialPayload.Types will
  be added.

  If this list contains fewer items than the InitialPayload.Types list,
  the last number is used as count for all following types. If this tag is not
  set, all counts are assumed to be 1.
