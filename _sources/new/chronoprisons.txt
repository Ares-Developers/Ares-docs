Chrono Prisons / Abductors


Originally intended for Yuri's Revenge, with published concept art and
even appearing on the original version of the box art, the Chrono Prison was
planned as a unit which would suck units into a "containment sphere" in its
turret; the turret would grow with each unit sucked in, and if the prison were
destroyed, the units would be free again. Original concept art on the Command
& Conquer Wiki .

Ares includes functionality which can be used to create such a unit, but
the implementation is liberal enough to use the parts for a variety of other
units.

[Weapon]Abductor=boolean
  If set to yes, weapons with this flag will absorb the target into the
  attacker's passenger hold. Should the attacking unit be destroyed, its
  passengers will emerge. Slaves' and spawned units' owner will be changed to
  the house `Special`. If the abductor is "full" or the victim cannot be
  abducted, conventional damage is dealt. Defaults to no.

   Please make sure you have a passenger hold when using this. Also
    remember that SizeLimit defaults to 0, so if you don't set it,
    abduction of most units will be denied. As usual, PipScale is
    required for all transports.

   Due to the way Passengers for buildings was tacked on, it is
    possible buildings with abducting weapons will not work properly. (Using
    InfantryAbsorb/UnitAbsorb increases your chances.) These
    malfunctions are considered out of the scope of the request and will not be
    considered bugs. The same goes for InfantryTypes. Malfunctions on
    VehicleTypes and AircraftTypes, on the other hand, should
    be reported immediately.

[Weapon]Abductor.Temporal=boolean
  Instead of abducting target units immediately, will abduct them only after
  they have been temporally erased. When the target unit would be warped away,
  it will be placed inside the abductor unit as passenger. If abduction fails,
  the target is erased normally. Requires Temporal=yes to be set on
  Warhead. Defaults to no.

[Weapon]Abductor.Anim=animation
  This animation will be spawned at the location a unit is abducted from.
  Defaults to none.

[Weapon]Abductor.ChangeOwner=boolean
  Sets whether the abducted unit shall change its owner to the abductor's house.
  Units which are ImmuneToPsionics=yes or which gained the
  PSIONICSIMMUNE veteran ability will not change owner. Defaults to
  no.

[Weapon]Abductor.AbductBelowPercent=float - percentage
  Specifies the percentage of health a unit has to go below to be abducted.
  Units with more health than this percentage will not be abducted. Defaults to
  100%.

[Weapon]Abductor.MaxHealth=integer - hitpoints
  The amount of hitpoints above which it cannot be abducted any longer. If
  0, health is not checked. Defaults to 0.

[TechnoType]ImmuneToAbduction=boolean
  Specifies whether the unit cannot be abducted. Only the conventional damage is
  dealt. Defaults to no.

[TechnoType]PassengerTurret=boolean
  If set to yes, this unit's turret will switch to the turret with the index
  equivalent to the number of passengers it holds. Defaults to no.

   In order to use this, you have to use YR's multi-turret logic, that
    is, you have to specify Turret=yes, an appropriate
    TurretCount, and you have to use the WeaponX flags to
    specify weapons.
