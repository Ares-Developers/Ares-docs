.. index: Cloak; Deactivated powered units will uncloak

Powered Units


Deactivated units (using either the PoweredBy= or PoweredUnit=
logic) and units whose drivers have been killed lose the ability to cloak
themselves, and they will uncloak automatically. The units are still allowed to
be cloaked by allied Cloak Generators in range.

.. index: Cloak; Parasites will not be ejected

Parasites


In the original Yuri's Revenge, parasites like the Terror Drone were
ejected from a unit when it cloaked. This has been changed so the parasite stays
inside the victim and continues damaging it.
