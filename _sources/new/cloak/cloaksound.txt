.. index: Cloak; Cloak and decloak sounds

Cloak Sounds


There was only one global sound used to indicate a change of cloak state.
Ares split this into two separate flags for cloaking and decloaking, and
made both of them customizable for each TechnoType.

[AudioVisual]DecloakSound=Sound
  The sound played when a unit or building decloaks. Defaults to
  [AudioVisual]►CloakSound.

TechnoTypes can override the global sounds. It does not matter whether
the unit cloaks itself or whether it is cloaked by a Cloak Generator.

[TechnoType]CloakSound=Sound
  The sound played when this object cloaks or submerges. Defaults to
  [AudioVisual]►CloakSound.

[TechnoType]DecloakSound=Sound
  The sound played when this object decloaks or emerges. Defaults to
  [AudioVisual]►DecloakSound.
