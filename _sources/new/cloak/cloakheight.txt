Cloaking and Units Above Ground


Units can now cloak and be cloaked by Cloak Generators regardless of their
height above ground, where they were only cloaked in Yuri's Revenge if
they sat directly on the ground, which prevented hover vehicles from recloaking
correctly. This is now supported.

Units with Cloakable=yes or the CLOAK ability can cloak
regardless of height. Other units will be cloaked by Cloak Generators only if
their height is below this value:

[General]CloakHeight=integer
  The height below which units are cloaked by Cloak Generator buildings. Units
  above this height will not be affected (though they can still self-cloak).
  Defaults to [General]â–ºHoverHeight.
  
   \ Yuri's Revenge defaulted to 0.
