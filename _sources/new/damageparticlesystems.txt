Damage Particle Systems


Damage particle systems are used to visually indicate a unit has been damaged
severely, by either emitting smoke when the unit enters yellow or red health or
by sparking repeatedly. See DamageParticleSystems on ModEnc
 for a thorough
description of this feature.

Damage Sparks


There was a hardcoded setting in the games since Tiberian Sun that
enabled InfantryTypes with Cyborg=yes to repeatedly spawn damage
spark particle systems when damaged into yellow or red health. The setting was
cleared whenever the infantry's section was not present in the map or scenario
file. Ares unties this feature from Cyborg and
InfantryTypes by making this a proper tag.

[TechnoType]DamageSparks=boolean
  Defines whether an object of this type should spawn spark particle systems
  defined by DamageParticleSystems. Defaults to Cyborg for
  InfantryTypes, to no otherwise.

Smoke and Spark DamageParticleSystems


Ares adds two new tags that allow arbitrary damage particle systems
where previously only one with either BehavesLike=Smoke or
BehavesLike=Spark were possible.

The new tag does not enforce the restrictions the original tag had. Without
opting in by using the new ones, damage particle systems are spawned as always.

 Only Smoke and Spark particle systems are fully
  supported as of Ares 0.7, because the others need special handling that is not
  yet in place.

[TechnoType]DamageSmokeParticleSystems=list of ParticleSystems
  Defines a list of ParticleSystems to randomly spawn from when an
  object is damaged into yellow or red health. You have to use this if you want
  to use ParticleSystems with BehavesLike set to other values
  than Smoke. Defaults to all DamageParticleSystems with
  BehavesLike=Smoke set.

[TechnoType]DamageSparksParticleSystems=list of ParticleSystems
  Defines a list of ParticleSystems to randomly spawn from when an
  object is in yellow or red health. You have to use this if you want
  to use ParticleSystems with BehavesLike set to other values
  than Spark. Defaults to all DamageParticleSystems with
  BehavesLike=Spark set.
