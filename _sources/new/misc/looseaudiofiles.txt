Loose Audio Files


The game can now load sounds from any wave files the game supports - they no
longer have to be packed into a bag file. The files can be read from the game's
folder or from mix files. Sounds should be referenced in soundmd.ini
just the same as always (without the .wav extension).

.. index: Sounds; WAV files loose in the folder or in the MIX files can be played without having to include them in audio.bag.
