 INI; [#include] allows rulesmd.ini to be split up into separate files

[#include]


Ares allows you to split your rulesmd.ini file up into separate
pieces so as to better organize the various settings. Any INI files you list
under the new [#include]► section will be loaded once the main file itself
has finished loading. INI files included in this manner can also specify their
own [#include]► section to load further INIs. There is no depth limit, and
the file loading recursion is depth-first (In English: if the original INI file
includes multiple files, and an included file includes other files itself, those
second-level files will be included before resuming inclusion of the remaining
first-level ones. Recurse again if necessary.)

For example, the [#include]► section you specify in rulesmd.ini
may look something like this:


::

    [#include]
    1=rules_sw.ini
    2=rules_vehicles.ini
    3=rules_buildings.ini
    4=rules_aircraft.ini
    5=rules_infantry.ini


As each INI file is loaded, any flag that is encountered that has already been
defined will have its value updated with the newly found value. Using the above
include list as an example, if [E1]►Strength=200 is specified in
rulesmd.ini, and [E1]►Strength=300 is specified in
rules_infantry.ini, then the GI will have Strength=300 in-game.

INI files are taken to be relative to the Red Alert 2 directory. Values
in the include list can include subfolders (e.g.
5=MyMod\rules_infantry.ini). The currently loaded MIXes are also scanned
for the files if a loose file of that name cannot be found, however, this only
works if you do not specify a subfolder.
