 Sounds; Multiple custom audio.bag files

Additional Bag Files


Yuri's Revenge only read audio.idx and audio.bag, either
requiring modders to deliver custom versions also including the original sound
files, or to rely on loose wave files.

Ares adds support for multiple index and bag files, which make it easier
to deliver sounds while also decreasing the mod's file sizes potentially. First
audio.idx is read as before, and then all files from audio01.idx
to audio99.idx, with the actual data in the corresponding .bag
file.

Index files loaded later can override sound files that were included earlier,
thus it is possible to update sound files using relatively small bag files for
patches.
