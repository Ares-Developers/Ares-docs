String Table Enhancements


More String Tables


In addition to ra2md.csf, the game will now load --
stringtable00.csf through stringtable99.csf. These string tables
will add to or replace strings that were included in previously loaded string
tables.

NOSTR Prefix


It is also now possible to name objects in INI code (without having to create a
string table entry) by using the NOSTR: prefix. For example,
UIName=NOSTR:Sonar Pulse will be displayed as "Sonar Pulse". However, the
string (including the prefix) cannot exceed 31 characters.

 String Tables; Object names can be written directly into rulesmd.ini
  rather than adding them to the string table.

Language-Neutral String Tables


String tables can now be marked as 'language neutral' by setting the language
field in the header to -1 (or FF FF FF FF in hexadecimal).
Files that are language neutral will always load, no matter what language the
main string table ra2md.csf is.

If your string table editor does not support setting the language manually, use
a hex edior to set the four bytes starting at offset 0x14 directly.
