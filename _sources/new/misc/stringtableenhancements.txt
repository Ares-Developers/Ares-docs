String Table Enhancements


In addition to ra2md.csf, the game will now load --
stringtable00.csf through stringtable99.csf. These string tables
will add to or replace strings that were included in previously loaded string
tables.

It is also now possible to name objects in INI code (without having to create a
string table entry) by using the NOSTR: prefix. For example,
UIName=NOSTR:Sonar Pulse will be displayed as "Sonar Pulse". However, the
string (including the prefix) cannot exceed 31 characters.

 String Tables; Object names can be written directly into rulesmd.ini
  rather than adding them to the string table.

The maximum number of strings in the string table has been increased to 20000.
