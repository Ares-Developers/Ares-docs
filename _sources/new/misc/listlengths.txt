.. index: INI; Several INI flag lists have been extended

List Lengths


There are several INI flags that take a comma-separated list of values. The game
imposes a maximum length for INI flag values of 128 characters which isn't
always long enough for lists -- especially with some of the extensions that
Ares allows. This limit has been relaxed *for flags that take lists* --
the maximum length for flags that take lists is now 512 characters (including
tag name and equal sign).
