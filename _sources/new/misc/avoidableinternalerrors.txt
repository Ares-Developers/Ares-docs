Avoidable Internal Errors


Snowmd.ini


[General]â–ºMedians=71
  This setting is needed to prevent an Internal Error occurring in the Random
  Map Generator if Urban Areas are enabled by the user. This change is also
  needed by the Terrain Expansion.

In order to avoid internal errors, Ares sets this to 71 by
default if it's not specified in the terrain control file.
