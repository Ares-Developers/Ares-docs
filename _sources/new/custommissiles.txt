 Missiles; Add new and customize the original missile types

Custom Missiles


Ares allows you to create new missile types and customize the existing
types (V3RocketType, DMislType, CMislType). Missiles are
AircraftTypes which have special logic attached to behave like a
projectile launched from another unit and carrying a warhead to its target.

Making Aircraft a Missile


Instead of defining the missile settings in the [General]► section,
Ares allows you to put them directly on the AircraftType. Apart
from that, the missiles work the same way the original launcher/missile pairs
work. This allows you to create an arbitrary number of new missiles.

[AircraftType]Missile.Custom=boolean
  Specifies whether this AircraftType should exhibit missile behavior.
  If set to yes it enables the missile tags listed below, which must
  be set to meaningful values. Not recommended on V3RocketType,
  DMislType and CMislType. Defaults to no.

   If you intend to override the original missiles defined as
    V3RocketType, DMislType and CMislType, you also have
    to define the following tags. Ares will not default to the original
    game tags for these types defined in the [General]► section.


Custom Missile Settings


The following tags are used only if [AircraftType]►Missile.Custom=yes is
set.

[AircraftType]Missile.PauseFrames=integer
  Defines how many frames the missile pauses on the launching unit before
  tilting. Defaults to 0.

[AircraftType]Missile.TiltFrames=integer
  Defines how many frames it takes for the missile to tilt to firing position.
  Defaults to 0.

[AircraftType]Missile.PitchInitial=float
  Defines the starting pitch of the missile before tilting up. Valid range is
  0.0 (horizontal) to 1.0 (vertical). Defaults to
  0.0.

[AircraftType]Missile.PitchFinal=float
  Defines the ending pitch of the missile after tilting up and when firing.
  Valid range is 0.0 (horizontal) to 1.0 (vertical).
  Defaults to 0.0.

[AircraftType]Missile.TurnRate=float
  Defines the pitch maneuverability of the missile in air. See original
  missiles for examples. Valid range is 0.0 to 1.0. Defaults
  to 0.0.

[AircraftType]Missile.RaiseRate=float
  Defines how much the missile will raise each turn on the launching unit.
  Defaults to 0.0.

[AircraftType]Missile.Acceleration=float
  Defines how much is added to the missile's velocity each frame during launch.
  Defaults to 0.0.

[AircraftType]Missile.Altitude=integer
  Defines the cruising altitude in leptons at which height missile begins
  leveling off. Defaults to 0.

[AircraftType]Missile.BodyLength=integer
  Defines how long the body of the missile is in leptons. This is used to draw
  the trailer. Defaults to 0.

[AircraftType]Missile.LazyCurve=boolean
  Whether the missile's path is a ballistic curve like the original V3 rocket.
  Otherwise the missile maintains the defined altitude. Defaults to
  no.


Warheads and Damage


[AircraftType]Missile.Damage=integer
  Defines how much damage the missile does when launched from a rookie or
  veteran unit. Defaults to 0.

[AircraftType]Missile.EliteDamage=integer
  Defines how much damage the missile does when launched from an elite unit.
  Defaults to 0.

[AircraftType]Missile.Warhead=Warhead
  Defines the warhead the missile uses to deliver damage when launching from
  a rookie or veteran unit. Defaults to none.

[AircraftType]Missile.EliteWarhead=Warhead
  Defines the warhead the missile uses to deliver damage when launching from
  an elite unit. Defaults to none.


 Missiles; Weapon instead of damage and warhead

Alternatively Using Weapons


Instead of using the pair of damage and warhead settings to deliver damage, it
is also possible to define a weapon that will fire when the missile explodes.
The weapon is used to control projectile, warhead, damage and bright settings
of a bullet that detonates immediately.

Note that missiles will not fall back to Missile.Weapon for elite units
in case Missile.EliteWeapon is not set. Missile.EliteDamage and
Missile.EliteWarhead are used instead.

 The weapons used for the tags below must be added to the
  WeaponTypes list or they might not be parsed correctly. See the
  debug.log if the missiles still use the damage and warhead for
  dealing damage.

[AircraftType]Missile.Weapon=Weapon
  The weapon used to deliver damage. If not set, Missile.Damage and
  Missile.Warhead are used to create the explosion. Defaults to
  none.

[AircraftType]Missile.EliteWeapon=Weapon
  The weapon used to deliver damage. If not set, Missile.EliteDamage and
  Missile.EliteWarhead are used to create the explosion. Defaults to
  none.



  Missiles; Trailer and take-off animations
  Art; Trailer and take-off animations for missiles

Trailer and Take-Off Animations


Aside from the missile settings you can customize the takeoff and trailer
animations. These settings can be used for any missile, whether they are custom
or not. Ares also optimizes away the lookup of the animation types,
thus it does not happen each time a new animation is to be created for each
missile.

[AircraftType]Missile.TakeOffAnim=Animation
  Defines the optional animation played when the missile takes off. Defaults to
  V3TAKOFF.

[AircraftType]Missile.TrailerAnim=Animation
  Defines the optional animation that is used to draw the trailer of this
  missile. Defaults to V3TRAIL.

[AircraftType]Missile.TrailerSeparation=integer
  Defines the number of frames to the creation of another trailer animation.
  Defaults to 3.
