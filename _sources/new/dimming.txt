Dimming Deactivated Units


The level deactivated voxel VehicleTypes are dimmed can be configured
here. The first applicable value is used, the other values will not be
considered. That is, if an unpowered unit is under EMP, DeactivateDimEMP
is used. This is purely cosmetic and the order may change in the future. A value
of 1.0 disables the dimming effect. Supported range is 0.0 to
1.0, higher values will brighten the unit.

 Shp VehicleTypes, as well as BuildingTypes,
  AircraftTypes and InfantryTypes are not affected by dimming.
