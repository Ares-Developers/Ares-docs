Type Selection Groups


In Yuri's Revenge, each of the three original sides have own dogs and
own engineer. If one player gets hold of equivalent units of other types, they
will not be considered for Type Selection. Thus you could have 20 dogs, but only
three would be selected, because the others are of different type.

Ares adds a method that has none of the limitations of the known
workarounds, that is, you can group an arbitrary amount of types, it is not
limited to infantry (it actually supports mixed types), has no side effects when
types are modified in maps and it doesn't crash.

 To group all dogs as one type of unit, set GroupAs=DOG on
  all of them. For engineers, use GroupAs=ENGINEER.

[TechnoType]GroupAs=string
  The group name this unit is considered as. Name length can be up to 30
  characters. Defaults to the type's ID.
  
   Check that you don't accidentally use an existing ID of a probably
    unrelated type as group name. This would include this type in this selection
    group, if it doesn't have GroupAs set to some other value itself.

[General]TypeSelectUseDeploy=boolean
  Whether the types in DeploysInto and UndeploysInto should be
  included for selection automatically. Defaults to yes.
  
   If you set this to no, Slave Miners, Tick Tanks and the
    like will differentiate between their deployed and undeployed forms. You
    will have to manually set GroupAs on the groups you want to keep.
