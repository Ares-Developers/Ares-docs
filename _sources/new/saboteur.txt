Saboteurs


Dune 2000 had the Saboteur, an infantry unit that could enter enemy
structures and destroy them immediately, sacrificing himself. This has been
re-created in Ares.

Only buildings owned by enemy players are sabotagable. If a building can be
sabotaged, the player gets the cursor named Sabotage, which is a new
customizable Mouse Cursor.

 The temporary cloak feature has not been implemented.

[InfantryType]Saboteur=boolean
  Whether this infantry can blow up a sabotagable building. The building will be
  destroyed as if C4 was placed, and the Saboteur is consumed in this process.
  Requires Infiltrate=yes. Not supported together with vehicle hijacking,
  CanDrive=yes, C4 (either C4=yes or granted through veterancy)
  and Occupier=yes logics. Defaults to no.

[BuildingType]ImmuneToSaboteurs=boolean
  Whether this building cannot be sabotaged. If yes, saboteurs cannot
  enter this structure. Defaults to yes for CanC4=no or
  TechLevel=-1 CanBeOccupied=yes buildings, to no
  otherwise.

  .. note: By default, unbuildable occupiable structures cannot be sabotaged.
    This prevents saboteurs from blowing up civilian structures when selected in
    a group with occupiers. This default value might change in the future.
