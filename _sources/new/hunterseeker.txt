Global Settings


The following tags define the defaults for the Hunter Seeker super weapons and
all VehicleTypes with HunterSeeker=yes set. The tags do not
default to meaningful values, but the values Tiberian Sun uses are given
here for reference.

Default for super weapons:

[SpecialWeapons]HSBuilding=list of BuildingTypes
  Buildings that can launch Hunter Seekers. BuildingTypes in this list
  do not have to provide the Hunter Seeker super weapon. Either this or the
  corresponding tag on the super weapon have to be set. If the player does not
  own any building from this list, the super weapon will discharge without a
  Hunter Seeker being launched. Defaults to none, Tiberian Sun
  uses GAPLUG,NATMPL.

Defaults for VehicleTypes:

[General]HunterSeekerDetonateProximity=integer
  Distance to target in leptons below which the Hunter Seeker will detonate.
  Defaults to 0, Tiberian Sun uses 150.
[General]HunterSeekerDescendProximity=integer
  Distance to target in leptons where the Hunter Seeker will start to descend.
  Defaults to 0, Tiberian Sun uses 700.
[General]HunterSeekerAscentSpeed=integer
  Speed value used while rising to a higher flight level. Defaults to
  0, Tiberian Sun uses 40.
[General]HunterSeekerDescentSpeed=integer
  Speed value used while going down to a lower flight level. Defaults to
  0, Tiberian Sun uses 50.
[General]HunterSeekerEmergeSpeed=integer
  Speed value used when ascending from the launch site. Defaults to 0,
  Tiberian Sun uses 6.

Hunter Seeker Unit Settings


These tags override the global tags for each unit type. Only the Fly locomotor
makes use of these values.

[VehicleType]HunterSeeker.DetonateProximity=integer
  Distance to target in leptons below which the Hunter Seeker will detonate.
  Defaults to [General]►HunterSeekerDetonateProximity.
[VehicleType]HunterSeeker.DescendProximity=integer
  Distance to target in leptons where the Hunter Seeker will start to descend.
  Defaults to [General]►HunterSeekerDescendProximity.
[VehicleType]HunterSeeker.AscentSpeed=integer
  Speed value used while rising to a higher flight level. Defaults to
  [General]►HunterSeekerAscentSpeed.
[VehicleType]HunterSeeker.DescentSpeed=integer
  Speed value used while going down to a lower flight level. Defaults to
  [General]►HunterSeekerDescentSpeed.
[VehicleType]HunterSeeker.EmergeSpeed=integer

  Hunter Seeker; Make units untargetable
  TechnoTypes; Disallow targeting by Hunter Seeker

Disallow Targeting


A TechnoType can be exempt from the target scan of all Hunter Seekers
enabling the tag below. This can help reduce frustration because vital or overly
expensive objects or insignificant or unreasonably cheap objects can be spared.
It can also be used for mission-critical objects in campaigns.

[TechnoType]HunterSeeker.Ignore=boolean
  Whether the Hunter Seeker will ignore targets of this type altogether, and not
  even randomly select them when no other target is eligible. Defaults to
  no.
