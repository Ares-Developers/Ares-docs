Self Heal


A unit's ability to self heal was hardcoded in Yuri's Revenge and aside
from enabling it through veterancy and setting the interval after which the unit
would regain a fixed amount of health.

Ares makes self healing much more customizable, which can be used to
recreate the Mammoth Tank from Tiberian Dawn, which only recovered half
of its health.
