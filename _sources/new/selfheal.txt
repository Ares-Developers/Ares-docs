Self Heal


A unit's ability to self heal was hardcoded in Yuri's Revenge and aside
from enabling it through veterancy and setting the interval after which the unit
would regain a fixed amount of health.

Ares makes self healing much more customizable, which can be used to
recreate the Mammoth Tank from Tiberian Dawn, which only recovered half
of its health.

[TechnoType]SelfHealing.Rate=double - minutes
  The minutes between applying the self heal. Defaults to
  [General]â–ºRepairRate.

[TechnoType]SelfHealing.Max=double - percentage
  The health level this object is restored to by self healing. The health will
  be capped at this percentage of the object's Strength. If defined,
  overrides the veterancy specific tags below. Defaults to 100%.

[TechnoType]SelfHealing.RookieMax=double - percentage

[TechnoType]SelfHealing.VeteranMax=double - percentage

[TechnoType]SelfHealing.EliteMax=double - percentage
  The health level this object is restored to by self healing, depending on its
  veterancy level. These settings are fully independent of each other. Defaults
  to SelfHealing.Max.

[TechnoType]SelfHealing.Amount=integer - hitpoints
  The amount of hitpoints restored when self healing. Cannot be less than
  0. If defined, overrides the veterancy specific tags below. Defaults
  to 1.

[TechnoType]SelfHealing.RookieAmount=integer - hitpoints

[TechnoType]SelfHealing.VeteranAmount=integer - hitpoints

[TechnoType]SelfHealing.EliteAmount=integer - hitpoints
  The amount of hitpoints restored when self healing, depending on its
  veterancy level. These settings are fully independent of each other. Cannot be
  less than 0. Defaults to SelfHealing.Amount.

Self healing can be interrupted for an amount of time when a unit is damaged.

[TechnoType]SelfHealing.CombatDelay=integer - frames
  Defines how long after a damaging attack a unit will not be able to self heal.
  Healing weapons do not trigger this delay. Use 0 to disable this.
  Defaults to 0.
