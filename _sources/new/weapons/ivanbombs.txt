Ivan Bombs


As with many other features of Yuri's Revenge, the settings that control
Crazy Ivan Bombs are global so you can't have multiple variations of them with
their own controls. With Ares it is now possible to create new Ivan
Bomb-esque weapons new types of sticky bomb with whatever settings you like.

Ares now also supports shrapnel weapons, as long as they have a
CellSpread of 0.5 or more.

When IvanBomb=yes is set on the weapon's warhead, the weapon can specify
the following flags in order to customize that bomb:

[Weapon]IvanBomb.Warhead=WarheadType
  The warhead that will be used when the bomb detonates. Defaults to
  [CombatDamage]►IvanWarhead.
[Weapon]IvanBomb.Damage=integer
  The damage that will be dealt when the bomb detonates. Defaults to
  [CombatDamage]►IvanDamage.
[Weapon]IvanBomb.Detachable=boolean
  Whether or not Engineers can remove this bomb from units it has been attached
  to. Defaults to yes.
[Weapon]IvanBomb.DestroysBridges=boolean
  Whether or not this bomb can be used on Bridge Repair Huts in order to destroy
  the corresponding Bridge. Defaults to yes.
  
   Bombs can always be attached to Bridge Huts, but the resulting
    explosion will not destroy the bridge unless
    IvanBomb.DestroysBridges=yes is set.
[Weapon]IvanBomb.CanDetonateTimeBomb=boolean
  Whether or not players can manually detonate bombs attached by this weapon.
  Defaults to [CombatDamage]►CanDetonateTimeBomb.
[Weapon]IvanBomb.Delay=integer
  The number of frames that will elapse before the bomb detonates automatically.
  Defaults to [CombatDamage]►IvanTimedDelay.
[Weapon]IvanBomb.AttachSound=sound name
  The sound that will be played when the bomb is attached to a target. Defaults
  to [AudioVisual]►BombAttachSound.
[Weapon]IvanBomb.TickingSound=sound name
  The sound that will be played whilst the bomb is attached to a unit. In order
  for this sound to loop correctly, the sound must have Control=loop set
  in its INI section in soundmd.ini. Defaults to
  [AudioVisual]►BombTickingSound.
[Weapon]IvanBomb.Image=filename, *excluding*the .shp extension
  The SHP file for the image to display over a unit that has a bomb attached to
  them, in the format "filename"(the ".shp" extension is automatically added by
  the engine). If the image cannot be loaded then the game will fall back to the
  default bombcurs.shp.
[Weapon]IvanBomb.FlickerRate=integer
  The rate at which the bomb SHP will flip back and forth between two frames to
  give the impression of a flickering fuse. Must be higher than 0.
  Defaults to [CombatDamage]►IvanIconFlickerRate.
  
  The animation is slowed down to play over the entire lifetime of the bomb
  (IvanBomb.Delay). The flicker rate is the number of frames between
  alternating between the current frame and the following frame.
  IvanBomb.FlickerRate=5 means the current frame is shown 5 frames, then
  the next one for 5 frames, then the current one again for 5 frames, ....

Originally this logic was hard-coded to ignore the last frame of the bomb SHP,
which was originally planned to be used for so called "death bombs" which were
cut from the game before Red Alert 2 was released. This hard-coding has
been changed so that the whole SHP is now considered for the fuse, however this
means that you'll now see that extra frame from bombcurs.shp, unless you
replace that SHP file.
