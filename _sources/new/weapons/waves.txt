Waves


Wave Effects


An unused weapon effect (present in the game code but disabled) has been
enabled. It is similar in appearance to the old laser beam or the old Disruptor
wave from previous games. For now it is referred to as *Laser*.

[Weapon]Wave.IsLaser=boolean
  Should the *Laser* effect be applied to this weapon?
[Weapon]Wave.IsBigLaser=boolean
  Should the *BigLaser* effect be applied to this weapon?

Wave.IsLaser and Wave.IsBigLaser produce two different effects,
however their naming was established before the effects were fully tested:
Wave.IsLaser appears to actually render a wider beam! See the image
below, left unit is using Wave.IsLaser, the right one is using
Wave.IsBigLaser:

The following flags are applicable to all Wave effects; the aforementioned
Wave.Is(Big)Laser=yes as well as Sonic=yes and
IsMagBeam=yes.


Wave Coloring


[Weapon]Wave.Color=R,G,B
  The color of the wave. Default value is different depending on the type of
  Wave.
[Weapon]Wave.IsHouseColor=boolean
  If this is set to yes then the wave will be drawn in the firing
  unit's house color instead of the color specified by Wave.Color.
  
 Sonic Waves do no yet have a sensible default Wave.Color.

 Waves can have custom colors.

Wave Direction


Waves are drawn in different directions (from firer to target or vice versa)
depending on the type of wave and the circumstances. This direction can now be
customized in several ways. The following flags all default to no
unless otherwise specified.

[Weapon]Wave.ReverseAgainstVehicles=boolean
  Whether or not the wave will be drawn from the target to the firer when the
  target is a VehicleType. Defaults to yes if
  IsMagBeam=yes is set on the weapon.
[Weapon]Wave.ReverseAgainstBuildings=boolean
  Whether or not the wave will be drawn from the target to the firer when the
  target is a BuildingType.
[Weapon]Wave.ReverseAgainstInfantry=boolean
  Whether or not the wave will be drawn from the target to the firer when the
  target is an InfantryType.
[Weapon]Wave.ReverseAgainstAircraft=boolean
  Whether or not the wave will be drawn from the target to the firer when the
  target is an AircraftType.
[Weapon]Wave.ReverseAgainstOthers=boolean
  Whether or not the wave will be drawn from target to firer when the target is
  anything not covered by the other ReverseAgainst flags (i.e. trees,
  overlays, empty cells, etc.). 

 Customisable wave direction.

Wave Ambient Damage

All waves can now deal disruptor-style damage to objects that they pass through,
a feature that was previously limited to Sonic Waves only. As a reminder, the
flags that control this are:

[Weapon]AmbientDamage=integer
  How much damage the wave deals to objects it passes through. Defaults to zero.
[Weapon]Warhead=WarheadType
  The warhead used to deal ambient damage as well as normal damage.
