  Facings; Weapon muzzle flashes

Anim for Facings


Anim supports either a single animation as muzzle flash when this weapon
fires, or a set of 8 animations to select from depending on the facing the
weapon was fired in.

Now you can also define 16 or 32 animations, without any further change.
Ares will pick this up automatically and use the largest power of 2
equal to or larger than 8 to select the best animation from for each firing
direction.

Fewer than 8 defined animations will result in only the first animation being
used.
