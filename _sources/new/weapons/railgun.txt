 Weapons; Detached railgun beams

Detached Railgun Beams


A unit cannot fire another railgun beam as long as the previously fired beam
dissolved completely. This new setting allows to get around that limitation.

 Mind that this could mean creating a large amount of particles, so
  overusing this feature might cause lag.

[Weapon]IsDetachedRailgun=boolean
  Whether this weapon is a railgun. Has the same particle effect as
  IsRailgun but does not have the limitation that the weapon cannot be
  fired again as long as the particle system created by firing the weapon
  previously subsided. Defaults to no.

   Combining IsDetachedRailgun=yes with IsRailgun=yes is
    not supported.
