 Weapons; Ordinary damage for IsSonic and UseFireParticles weapons

Ordinary Damage for IsSonic and UseFireParticles


Weapons with either IsSonic=yes or UseFireParticles=yes do not
deliver conventional damage and rely on other means like ambient damage.

[Weapon]ApplyDamage=boolean
  Whether this weapon deals ordinary damage. Can be used to enable Damage
  to work with special weapons, or to disable dealing damage. Defaults to
  no if either IsSonic=yes or UseFireParticles=yes, to
  yes otherwise.

   If ApplyDamage=no, the damage is reduced to 0, thus some
    weapon effects like the warhead's animation will not play. This might change
    in the future.
