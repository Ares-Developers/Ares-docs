Radiation Beams


Before Ares, Radiation beams could not be customized -- they were always
either green or blue depending on the type of weapon. Now, however, radiation
beams can be customized using the following flags (which affect weapons with
IsRadBeam=yes set and/or IsRadEruption=yes set) in the weapon's
INI section: 

[Weapon]Beam.Color=R,G,B
  The color that the beam will be drawn in. Defaults to
  [AudioVisual]►ChronoBeamColor for weapons with a Temporal warhead, and
  [Radiation]►RadColor for weapons with a non-Temporal warhead.
[Weapon]Beam.IsHouseColor=boolean
  Whether or not the beam should be drawn using the firing unit's player color
  instead of the specific color specified by Beam.Color.
[Weapon]Beam.Duration=integer
  The number of frames for which the beam should be visible. Default is
  15 as per original RadBeams. The RadEruption effect originally used
  a random value between 5 and 20.
[Weapon]Beam.Amplitude=float
  The amplitude of the beam (possibly measured in pixels?). Defaults to
  40.0 as per original RadBeams. The RadEruption effect originally used
  a random value between 100.0 and 500.0.
