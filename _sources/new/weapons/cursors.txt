Cursors


It is now possible in Ares to customize the weapon cursors to give
certain special weapons dedicated attack cursors.

With these cursors, it's also possible to mimic the behavior of the
SabotageCursor and MigAttackCursor special cases. If both are set
to the same cursor, they behave like the two mentioned tags, which also work
independent of range, like the C4 special ability cursor. Also, this is useful
for suicide units like the Terrorist or the Demolition Truck, which are almost
always out of range.

The following two tags accept cursor names as defined under
Mouse Cursors.

[Weapon]Cursor.Attack=mouse cursor
  The cursor to use as the attack cursor for this weapon. This cursor is used if
  only one unit is selected and its target is in range. Defaults to
  Attack.

[Weapon]Cursor.AttackOutOfRange=mouse cursor
  The cursor used if an object can attack a target, but it is out if weapon's
  range and the unit needs to move first to attack it. Defaults to
  AttackOutOfRange.

   If two or more units are selected, this cursor is not used. Note
    that deployed units will get their No Move cursor instead, as they would
    have to, but cannot move.

There's no cursor to show in case a unit cannot attack a target (for instance
it might not be mind-controllable, etc.), because the game does not have a
concept of this. Instead the next type of cursor is checked, and sometimes the
inability to attack gets converted to a different action like move, no move, or
select (or something entirely different like enter for Engineer infantry).
