AlternateTheaterArt


The Navy Seal has AlternateArcticArt=yes set, which causes the game to
use the image file seala.shp on arctic maps, instead of
seal.shp. This logic works for any InfantryType, however this
only works for the arctic theater and only for InfantryTypes.

[TechnoType]AlternateTheaterArt=boolean
  Specifies whether or not this SHP-based unit can have alternate art depending
  on the theater of the current map. For example, setting Image=JUNK and
  AlternateTheaterArt=yes on a unit will make the unit load
  artmd.ini section [JUNKA]► on arctic, [JUNKD]► on desert,
  and so on according to theater. If any of those sections do not exist then the
  unit will fall back to [JUNK]►. So quite similar to
  AlternateArcticArt, just automatic and smarter. Defaults to
  no.

 This only works for SHP-based units. Voxels do not use this system and
  cannot have theater-specific art (you'd have to use
  Prerequisite.RequiredTheaters to achieve that).
