Hard-coded Unit Properties


The game is hard-coded to do certain things with certain unit IDs. Namely the
[COW]► and [DESO]►. These units can now have said special properties
switched off, and other units can be given these properties if you want.
Hard-coded properties of Cows and Desolators can be toggled on/off for any
infantry.


 Infantry; Move around randomly like a cow

IsCow


The [COW]► was hard-coded to play its idle animation more frequently than
other infantry and was also hard-coded to move around randomly. You can now set
IsCow=yes on other InfantryTypes or, indeed, IsCow=no on
the [COW]►.

[InfantryType]IsCow=boolean
  Defaults to yes for [COW]►, otherwise to no.

 Infantry;Desolator special handling

IsDesolator


The [DESO]► was hard-coded to have different deploy-weapon firing timing
than other units to coincide with the unit's art Sequence.

Deployable infantry that is also ImmuneToRadiation=yes has an additional
hardcoded effect which causes the unit to automatically fire at the ground when
deployed, depending on the radiation of the cell the unit is deployed on and the
RadLevel of the infantry's secondary weapon.

You can now set IsDesolator=yes on other InfantryTypes or,
indeed, IsDesolator=no on the [DESO]►.

[InfantryType]IsDesolator=boolean
  Whether the firing timing and deploy behavior is changed for this infantry
  unit as described above. Defaults to yes for [DESO]►, otherwise
  to no.
