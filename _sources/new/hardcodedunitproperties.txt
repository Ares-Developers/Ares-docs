Hard-coded Unit Properties


The game is hard-coded to do certain things with certain unit IDs. Namely the
[COW]► and [DESO]►. These units can now have said special properties
switched off, and other units can be given these properties if you want.
Hard-coded properties of Cows and Desolators can be toggled on/off for any
infantry.


 Infantry; Move around randomly like a cow

IsCow


The [COW]► was hard-coded to play its idle animation more frequently than
other infantry and was also hard-coded to move around randomly. You can now set
IsCow=yes on other InfantryTypes or, indeed, IsCow=no on
the [COW]►.

[InfantryType]IsCow=boolean
  Defaults to yes for [COW]►, otherwise to no.

 Infantry;Desolator special handling

IsDesolator


The [DESO]► was hard-coded to have different deploy-weapon firing timing
than other units. The change to the timing appears to be related to the unit's
art Sequence although the exact effect has not been investigated. You can
now set IsDesolator=yes on other InfantryTypes or, indeed,
IsDesolator=no on the [DESO]►.

[InfantryType]IsDesolator=boolean
  Defaults to yes for [DESO]►, otherwise to no.
