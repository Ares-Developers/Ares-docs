 Animations; Spawn particles at a distance

Particle Spawning


Animations can spawn particles using SpawnsParticle, but no matter how
many are spawned, they would always spawn at the exact same location as the
animation. These new tags allow customizing the distance from the center the
particles will be spawned at.

This feature divides the circle around animation's base coords into
NumParticles sections. Each section will get exactly one spawned
particle. The height above ground will be the same as the animation's height
above the base cell.

[AnimType]SpawnsParticle.RangeMinimum=double - cells
  The distance from the center where particles start spawning at. Defaults to
  0.0.
  
   If negative, the resulting random distance could come out as
    negative. If this happens, the absolute value is used. This allows doubling
    the chance to spawn particles closer to the center.

[AnimType]SpawnsParticle.RangeMaximum=double - cells
  The distance from the center where particles will not spawn beyond. Has to be
  equal to or larger than SpawnsParticle.RangeMinimum. Defaults to
  0.0.
