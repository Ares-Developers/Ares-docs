 Buildings; Sell Units

Sell Units


With Ares, selling units when they dock at buildings like Repair Depots
can be disabled per structure, and specific units can be made unsellable on dock
structures.

[BuildingType]UnitSell=boolean
  Whether this building can sell docked units. Human players can click the Sell
  button and move it over the docked unit. The cursor will change to the
  SellUnit cursor. Defaults to UnitRepair.

[TechnoType]Unsellable=boolean
  Whether this unit can be sold at UnitSell=yes docking structures.
  Defaults to [General]â–ºUnitsUnsellable=.

[General]UnitsUnsellable=boolean
  Whether units are by default Unsellable=yes and thus not sellable at
  UnitSell=yes docking structures. Defaults to no.
