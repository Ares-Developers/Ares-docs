Trailer


The original Drop Pod trailer was not customizable and also not implemented in
an optimal way. Now the animation is looked up only once, not once for each Drop
Pod every six frames. Also, the smoke trailer now is created even if the Drop
Pod does not have a [General]►DropPodWeapon set.

[General]DropPodTrailer=AnimationType
  The animation used as smoke trailer for Drop Pods. Defaults to
  SMOKEY.

Global Super Weapon Defaults


The following tags define the defaults for the Drop Pod super weapons. The tags
do not default to meaningful values, but the values Firestorm uses are
given here for reference.

[General]DropPodTypes=list of InfantryTypes
  The types to randomly choose from when spawning units for the Drop Pod super
  weapon. Each type has an equal chance of being selected. You can add types
  more than once. Only infantry is supported. Defaults to none,
  Firestorm uses an equivalent E1,E2.
[General]DropPodMinimum=integer
  The minimum number of Drop Pods being created. Defaults to 0,
  Firestorm uses 5.
[General]DropPodMaximum=integer
  The maximum number of Drop Pods being created. Defaults to 0,
  Firestorm uses 8.


Miscellaneous


If the weapon used as [General]►DropPodWeapon does not have at least one
valid Report sound set, the game will not crash any more when a Drop Pod
is spawned.
