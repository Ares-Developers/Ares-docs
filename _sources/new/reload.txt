ReloadAmount and EmptyReloadAmount


The game has options for Reload and EmptyReload to define how long
it takes to reload one round of ammunition, depending on whether the unit still
has ammo left. Ares adds two new tags to define how many rounds of
ammunition are restored.

This logic is not supported on AircraftTypes.

[TechnoType]ReloadAmount=integer
  The number of rounds restored after each reload interval. Negative values are
  supported. Defaults to 1.

[TechnoType]EmptyReloadAmount=integer
  The number of rounds restored after reload interval when there is no ammo
  left. If 0 or negative, the unit will not reload. This does not
  require EmptyReload to be set. Defaults to ReloadAmount.
