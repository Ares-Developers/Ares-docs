Mouse Cursors


For several features Ares allows to customize mouse cursors. Mouse
cursors can be defined in two ways: As a set of six separate tags, or using a
single tag and comma separated values.

In the following list, [Section]â–ºBaseTag represents the cursor's base
name. Replace this with the actual name. The default values depend on the base.

[Section]BaseTag.Frame=integer
  Starting frame of the cursor from mouse.sha. The first frame is
  0.

[Section]BaseTag.Count=integer
  Number of frames in the animated cursor.

[Section]BaseTag.Interval=integer
  The rate to animate the cursor. Default is 5.

[Section]BaseTag.MiniFrame=integer
  Same as BaseTag.Frame, except this is for the mouse cursor when
  positioned on the minimap. Set this to -1 to disable the minimap
  cursor and to only allow players to click on the battlefield.

[Section]BaseTag.MiniCount=integer
  Same as BaseTag.Count, except this is for the mouse cursor when
  positioned on the minimap.

[Section]BaseTag.HotSpot=HotSpotX,HotSpotY
  Specifies the coordinates on the cursor that are considered to be the 'tip' --
  that is, the point from which the click event will handled. HotSpotX should
  be one of Left, Center or Right. HotSpotY should
  be one of Top, Middle or Bottom. For example,
  BaseTag.HotSpot=Left,Top will treat the top-left corner of the cursor
  as the tip. Default is Center,Middle.

All these tags can be defined by putting them into a single line, using the same
values as described above:

[Section]BaseTag=cursor definition
  Enter the values from above in the given order, separated by commas:
  Frame,Count,Interval,MiniFrame,MiniCount,HotSpotX,HotSpotY.

   You cannot directly use the same definitions as used with other
    patches for Yuri's Revenge, because Ares uses descriptive
    names instead of numbers for the HotSpotX,HotSpotY parts. To convert the
    values, replace 0 by either Left or Top,
    12345 by either Center or Middle, and
    54321 by either Right or Bottom.
