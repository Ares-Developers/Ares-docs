Cursors on Units and Structures


Cursors can be customized for each unit or structure to give them a unique
appearance or to express the kind of special functionality better than the
generic cursors can.

All of these settings take a named cursor defined under
Mouse Cursors. Also see how to use custom
weapon cursors.


 Cursors; Movement

Movement


These cursors are used for a variety of functions: setting the rally point for
factories, undeploying structures, and giving units move orders, but they might
also be used as fallback for other functions that can't be used, for instance
when a target can't be attacked or an object cannot be entered.

[TechnoType]Cursor.Move=mouse cursor
  The cursor to use for representing the move action. Defaults to Move.

[TechnoType]Cursor.NoMove=mouse cursor
  The cursor to use for representing the no-move action. Defaults to
  NoMove.


 single: Cursors; Deploy, eject, area attack

Deploy


Deploy cursors are used for a variety of different functions like for deploying
buildings, ejecting passengers and occupants, emptying bunkers, deploying GIs or
Desolators, as well as for ordering area attacks like on the Yuri Clone.

[TechnoType]Cursor.Deploy=mouse cursor
  The cursor used for deploying actions. Defaults to Deploy.

[TechnoType]Cursor.NoDeploy=mouse cursor
  The cursor used to indicate a building cannot be deployed, passenger cannot
  be ejected, or an automatically undeploying infantry is currently deployed.
  Defaults to NoDeploy.


 Cursors; Enter or dock

Enter


Unlike the other cursors, the enter cursor of the object the mouse is hovering
over is used. The enter cursor represents several different actions. For
instance, this is used for entering Tank Bunkers (Bunker=yes), Bio
Reactors (InfantryAbsorb=yes and/or UnitAbsorb=yes), Grinders
(Grinding=yes), Service Depots or aircraft docks (UnitRepair=yes),
or entering transports.

Note that certain actions cannot be customized using the following cursors.
Despite the cursor is the enter cursor, entering occupiable structures is
actually a capture action. Spy enter can be customized with the setting below.
Also, the enter action for saboteurs and hijackers are represented with
specialized cursors.

[TechnoType]Cursor.Enter=mouse cursor
  The enter cursor other objects get when hovering the mouse over an object of
  this type. Defaults to Enter.

[TechnoType]Cursor.NoEnter=mouse cursor
  The cursor other objects get when hovering the mouse over an object of this
  type while entering is not possible. This is used on full transports. Defaults
  to NoEnter.


 Cursors; Infiltrate buildings

Spy Infiltration


The spy cursor can be customized for each building type, so Agent=yes
infantry can get a cursor that might be tailored to the spy effect of that
building type when infiltrating.

[BuildingType]Cursor.Spy=mouse cursor

  Enter.
