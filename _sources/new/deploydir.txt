 TechnoTypes; DeployDir for each type

DeployDir


Originally, this setting was used for DeployToLand=yes units. When
ordered to deploy, they would turn towards this direction first.

With Ares, all units having a DeployingAnim will turn towards
this direction first when deploying, ignoring DeployToLand. This way,
deploying anims can hide the transition of unit types better, while units not
having a DeployingAnim do not turn needlessly.

[TechnoType]DeployDir=integer - facing
  The direction a unit will face when deploying. Valid values range from
  0 for north to 7 for north west. Defaults to
  [General]â–ºDeployDir.
