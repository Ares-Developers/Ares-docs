Chain Reactions


There are two distinct logics that have their part in the tiberium chain
reactions as seen in Tiberian Sun. Chain Reactions were not supported
in Yuri's Revenge and have now been restored, and both have been made
more customizable.

Tiberium Explosion


Tiberium Explosion occurs if an animation with TiberiumChainReaction=yes
hits a cell containing tiberium. There is a chance that debris is spawned. For a
more detailed description, refer to TiberiumChainReaction on ModEnc
.

The warhead, the damage delivered and the chance to spawn debris can be
customized for each of the Tiberiums.


Chain Reaction


Overlay can be made to trigger a chain reaction when damaged. An animation is
spawned on the neighbor cells that can propagate the effect. For a more detailed
description, refer to ChainReaction on ModEnc
.

The logic has been restored and new works as in Tiberian Sun. The
warhead can be customized for each of the Tiberiums.


Customizable Settings


[Tiberium]ExplosionWarhead=warhead
  The warhead used to deliver the damage of the chain reaction effect, as well
  as the damage of the Tiberium Explosion effect. Defaults to
  [General]►C4Warhead.
  
   \ Tiberian Sun's C4Warhead was HE, which had
    Spread set. Red Alert 2 uses Super, which does
    not.

[Tiberium]ExplosionDamage=integer
  The damage an animation with TiberiumChainReaction=yes deals to the
  cell it impacts at. Defaults to [CombatDamage]►TiberiumExplosionDamage.

[Tiberium]Debris.Chance=integer - percent
  The chance a cell containing this tiberium type hit by an animation with
  TiberiumChainReaction=yes will spawn one of its Debris. Defaults
  to 33.


 Overlay; Explodes=yes and minimum damage

Minimum Damage to Trigger Explodes=yes


Overlay with Explodes=yes detonates when taking even the slightest amount
of damage. With Ares you can raise this limit so overlay only explodes
if the damage is higher than a certain value.

[General]OverlayExplodeThreshold=integer
  Only if the damage to a cell is higher than this does an overlay with
  Explodes=yes explode. Below this value, the overlay stays intact.
  Defaults to 0.
