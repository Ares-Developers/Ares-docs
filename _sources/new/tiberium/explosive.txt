 Tiberium; Full harvesters explode

Tiberium Explosive


Tiberium Explosive is the feature that harvester units detonate violently on
destruction. It is not to be confused with the similarly named Tiberium
Explosion.

The damage to deliver depends on Power of the contained tiberium bails.
This is like it was in Firestorm. Tiberian Sun also added the
harvester unit's strength, which has not been recreated.

Tiberian Sun used C4Warhead to deliver the damage, with a
hardcoded spread of 1.5. Ares requires the warhead to define
CellSpread itself.

Only positive damage is delivered. In case TiberiumExplosiveWarhead is
not set or the Harvester Truce feature is enabled, no damage is delivered.

[CombatDamage]TiberiumExplosive=boolean
  Whether tiberium inside of harvester units explodes using
  TiberiumExplosiveWarhead when destroyed. Defaults to no.

[CombatDamage]TiberiumExplosiveWarhead=warhead
  The warhead to deliver the damage of explosive tiberium. Defaults to
  none.

[CombatDamage]TiberiumExplosiveAnim=animation
  Optional animation displayed when Tiberium contained in a unit explodes. Can
  be used independently of damage delivery; TiberiumExplosiveWarhead
  needs not be set. Defaults to none.
