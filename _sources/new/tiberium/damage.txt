Tiberium Damage


Infantry being damaged when walking on tiberium (not just standing there) is a
feature of Tiberian Dawn and Tiberian Sun. Ares brings
this feature back and extends it to work with all unit types.

Units killed by Tiberium Damage may convert into a Visceroid. See
Visceroids

Enabling Tiberium Damage


Ares requires a new tag to be set to enable the Damage feature, and it
does no longer damage units that are positioned above
[General]►HoverHeight.

[General]TiberiumDamageEnabled=boolean
  Whether tiberium damages units that are not tiberium proof. Required for the
  following tags to work. Defaults to no.


Who gets damaged


All units that are not tiberium proof (neither through the tag
TiberiumProof nor through the TIBERIUM_PROOF veteran ability)
will be damaged when entering a cell containing tiberium. It does not matter how
long they stay in a cell.

[TechnoType]TiberiumProof=boolean
  Whether this unit is immune to tiberium damage. Defaults to no for
  InfantryTypes, to yes otherwise.


Damage and Warhead


The damage and the warhead used to deliver it can be customized for each of the
Tiberiums. This allows to have damaging and non-damaging resources at
the same time, for example Tiberium and ore respectively.

[Tiberium]Damage=integer
  The damage a unit that is not tiberium proof receives from entering a cell
  containing this type of Tiberium. Defaults to Power / 10, but at
  least 1.

[Tiberium]Warhead=warhead
  The warhead that deals the Tiberium Damage. Defaults to
  [CombatDamage]►C4Warhead.

   This is not used for the Tiberium Explosive feature.

  Universe; Tiberium spawns visceroids on infantry death

Visceroids


Visceroids have been recreated partially.

They will move around the map, and when two units with SmallVisceroid=yes
(not [General]►SmallVisceroid) meet, they will merge into a unit of type
[General]►LargeVisceroid.

 Visceroids will not yet retreat to a patch of tiberium to regenerate
  health when badly damaged.

When units die because of Tiberium Damage, there is a chance they will spawn a
unit of type [General]►SmallVisceroid (if defined). This logic requires
[Basic]►TiberiumDeathToVisceroid=yes in a map to work. The Visceroid is
owned by the country Neutral. 

Ares adds a global tag that can be customized for each type. The global
tag existed since Tiberian Sun but did not do anything.

[General]TiberiumTransmogrify=integer - percent
  Chance of which a unit dying of tiberium damage transforms into a
  [General]►SmallVisceroid. Defaults to 0.

[TechnoType]TiberiumTransmogrify=integer - percent
  Chance of which a unit of this type dying of tiberium damage transforms into a
  [General]►SmallVisceroid. Defaults to
  [General]►TiberiumTransmogrify.
