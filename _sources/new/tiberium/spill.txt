 Tiberium; Technos can lose tiberium on destruction

Tiberium Spill


Units carrying or buildings storing tiberium can spill their contents when
destroyed. This behavior is applied by default in Tiberian Sun, and it
is optional in Ares.

[TechnoType]TiberiumSpill=boolean
  Whether this techno with positive Storage will spill parts of its
  stored tiberium when destroyed. Defaults to no.

Buildings like Refineries and Silos will spill as many bails as they have
stored. The spilled tiberium type depends on the tiberium stored inside the
building.

Units like Harvesters and Slaves can spill up to 9 bails of the first resource
from the Tiberiums list depending on fill state, but not more than the
unit's Storage.
