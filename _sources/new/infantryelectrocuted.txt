InfantryElectrocuted


The animation displayed for a dying InfantryType when the warhead that
killed them had InfDeath=5 used to be hard-coded to the second animation
from the [Animations]► list. You can now specify
[AudioVisual]►InfantryElectrocuted= instead.

[AudioVisual]InfantryElectrocuted=animation
  If InfantryElectrocuted is not defined then the game will search for an
  animation named ELECTRO, before finally falling back to the second
  animation like before.
