Pips


In Yuri's Revenge, the values that were accepted for Pip and
OccupyPip were hardcoded to a list of known names. While fixing the
Pip Distortion Bug, Ares makes
this more flexible.

Any tag that defines a pip accepts an alternative notation now. If the tag value
cannot be resolved using the list of known names (like personblue), the
value is parsed as integer. The integers are used as frame index into the pips
files (pips.shp and pips2.shp).

If the value is neither a known name nor an integer, a parsing error is put into
debug.log.

[TechnoType]Pip=integer
  Frame index in the pips file to use as pip image. Valid values range from
  0 to the pip file's frame count - 1.

   If the tag is read as integer and the value is out of bounds, no
    error is logged in debug.log.
