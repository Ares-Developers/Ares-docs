 Animations; Choose the owner for MakeInfantry animations

MakeInfantryOwner


The original MakeInfantry logic would always grant ownership of
newly-created infantry to the neutral side, unless the animation was caused by
an InfantryType being killed by an InfDeath=9 warhead (in which
case the killing player would get ownership of the new InfantryType).
Ares lets you choose which player will gain ownership, from one of
several options.

[Animation]MakeInfantryOwner=enumeration invoker|killer|victim|civilian|special|neutral|random
  Specifies which house will own the resulting InfantryType that gets
  created after this animation has played. The animation's remappable colors
  will be shown in that house's color, if not noted otherwise. Defaults to
  invoker.

   If you are creating a chain of animations using the Next= tag
    then MakeInfantry= goes on the last animation whereas
    MakeInfantryOwner= goes on the first animation - that is, the
    animation that was initially invoked.

Note that this is not a warhead property; it goes on the corresponding animation
entry in artmd.ini. However, MakeInfantryOwner only works for
specific animations; namely those invoked by InfDeathAnim,
DeathAnims, InfantryExplode, FlamingInfantry,
InfantryElectrocuted, InfantryHeadPop, InfantryNuked,
InfantryVirus, InfantryMutate, InfantryBrute, and map
triggers. The default MakeInfantryOwner is invoker, which
corresponds to a different player depending on the animation.


+ For InfDeathAnim, InfantryVirus and InfantryMutate,
  invoker represents killer (the owner of the killing unit).
  For InfantryVirus on a NotHuman=no victim, the remappable colors
  are **not** used. If you want them, use killer explicitly.
+ For InfantryExplode, FlamingInfantry,
  InfantryElectrocuted, InfantryHeadPop, InfantryNuked, and
  InfantryBrute, invoker represents the neutral house with the
  remappable colors **not** being used. If you want the remapped colors, you
  have to use neutral explicitly.
+ For DeathAnims, invoker represents victim (the owner
  of the dying unit).
+ For map triggers, invoker, killer and victim all
  represent the house that is considered to be the owner of the trigger.


random will pick a random player from all players in the game,
including the houses available as neutral, special and
civilian.

 Like InfDeath=9, mutation animations will be rendered in the
  unit palette with remap colors instead of anim.pal, if not noted
  otherwise.
