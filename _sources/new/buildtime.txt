  Factories; Build time fully customizable per type

Build Time


In Ares it is possible to customize all settings related to the build
time of objects per type.

[TechnoType]BuildTime.Speed=double - minutes
  The time in minutes it takes to produce an object which costs 1000 credits.
  Defaults to [General]►BuildSpeed.

   If set, WallBuildSpeedCoefficient will not be applied to
    Wall=yes buildings any more, because BuildTime.Speed is taken
    as final value.
[TechnoType]BuildTime.Cost=integer - credits
  If set, the build time is calculated as if this item cost this much, instead
  of using actual Cost. Defaults to Cost.

If the player does not have enough power, the following settings apply. They
define a factor applied to the amount of power lacking and the range the
resulting modifier will be clamped in before being multipled with the build
time.

[TechnoType]BuildTime.LowPowerPenalty=double - multiplier
  The penalty to apply to the build time in low power situations. Defaults to
  [General]►LowPowerPenaltyModifier.

[TechnoType]BuildTime.MinLowPower=double
  The minimum production speed when power is low. The resulting low power
  modifier will not be lower than this. Defaults to
  [General]►MinLowPowerProductionSpeed.

[TechnoType]BuildTime.MaxLowPower=double
  The maximum production speed when power is low. The resulting low power
  modifier will not be greater than this. Defaults to
  [General]►MaxLowPowerProductionSpeed.

When a player has more than one factory of the same type, the following modifier
also applies.

[TechnoType]BuildTime.MultipleFactory=double - multiplier
  The factor multiplied by the build time per additional factory of the same
  type. Defaults to [General]►MultipleFactory.
