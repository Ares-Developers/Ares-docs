Manual Control


No Manual Target Selection


Like EMPulseCannon, this disallows players to manually select targets,
but it neither prevents the object from picking its own targets automatically,
nor to retaliate.

[TechnoType]NoManualFire=boolean
  Whether players may not select targets for this type of object manually. If
  enabled, units will have to rely on auto-targeting and retaliation rules.
  Defaults to no.

 Behavior; Disallow manual target selection, Hide attack cursor

 0.A


No Manual Passenger Unload


This setting disallows players to manually eject the passengers. This is useful
for vehicles that are no real transports, like Chrono Prisons.

By default, passengers might still be ejected when the vehicle is destroyed. To
change this, set the Passenger Survivor Chance
accordingly.

[VehicleType]NoManualUnload=boolean
  Whether this vehicle is disallowed to eject its passengers. If enabled, the
  owning player will not get deploy or no-deploy cursors. Defaults to
  no.

 Behavior; Disallow manual passenger unload, Hide unload cursor
