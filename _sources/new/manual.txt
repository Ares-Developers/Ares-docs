Manual Control


No Manual Target Selection


Like EMPulseCannon, this disallows players to manually select targets,
but it neither prevents the object from picking its own targets automatically,
nor to retaliate.

[TechnoType]NoManualFire=boolean
  Whether players may not select targets for this type of object manually. If
  enabled, units will have to rely on auto-targeting and retaliation rules.
  Defaults to no.

 Behavior; Disallow manual target selection, Hide attack cursor

No Manual Passenger Unload


This setting disallows players to manually eject the passengers. This is useful
for vehicles that are no real transports, like Chrono Prisons.

By default, passengers might still be ejected when the vehicle is destroyed. To
change this, set the Passenger Survivor Chance
accordingly.

[VehicleType]NoManualUnload=boolean
  Whether this vehicle is disallowed to eject its passengers. If enabled, the
  owning player will not get deploy or no-deploy cursors. Defaults to
  no.

 Behavior; Disallow manual passenger unload, Hide unload cursor

No Manual Enter Transport


This cosmetic setting allows to hide the fact that a unit is a transport by
removing the enter and no-enter cursors.

This does not prevent units from entering by other means, like scripts, though.
Also, the AI will not respect this setting. Use the Specific Passengers feature to prevent this.

[TechnoType]NoManualEnter=boolean
  Whether units will not get an enter or no-enter cursor when on this object. If
  yes, the select cursor is used, as if this unit is not a transport.
  Defaults to no.

 Behavior; Disallow units to get an enter cursor over a transport

No Guard Area on Self


Medics usually get a guard area cursor on themselves to players can set the to
guard mode by clicking. This prevents infantry with negative damage weapons to
have deploy ability. Ares adds a tag to turn this feature off.

[InfantryType]NoSelfGuardArea=boolean
  Whether infantry units with negative damage weapons get the guard area cursor
  on themselves. If no, the guard area cursor will not take precedence,
  allowing other cursors like the deploy cursor to be shown. Defaults to
  no.

 Behavior; Disable Medics' Guard Area cursor on self
