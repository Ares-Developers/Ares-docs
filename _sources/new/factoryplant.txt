Factory Plant Effect


The cost reduction effect of FactoryPlant buildings like the Industrial
Plant can be modified per TechnoType, using this multiplier.

[TechnoType]FactoryPlant.Multiplier=double - multiplier
  The effect of the respective CostBonus tag for this type is multiplied
  by this value to either increase, decrease, or nullify the effect. Fully
  supported values range from -1.0 to reverse the effect to
  1.0 to not apply the effect. 0.0 nullifies the bonus.
  Defaults to 1.0.

   Values beyond 1.0 can potentially cause the cost to drop to
    zero, if the effect of the product of all cost bonuses is multiplied by a
    too large value. This is because the effect of this multiplier is linear.

An example: If the cost bonus is 0.6 and the multiplier is
0.5, then the final bonus will be 0.8. In other words: if a
bonus reduces the cost to 60% and the multiplier only grants half of that, the
final price will be at 80% of the original cost.
