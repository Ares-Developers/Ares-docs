Drain Weapon Options


Unlike defensive structures or refineries, draining power plants always affects
the player's entire power, not just what is produced locally. Ares adds
some tags to make this customizable.

[TechnoType]Drain.Local=boolean
  Whether this unit drains only the local power from its target building, or
  whether this building does not bring down the entire power grid of the owning
  player when drained. If any of the draining unit or the building drained have
  this set to yes, only the local power is drained. If both have this
  set to no, then the victim's entire power is drained. Defaults to
  no.

[TechnoType]Drain.Amount=integer
  The amount of power drained from a power plant of the victim player. Requires
  Drain.Local=yes on either the draining unit or the drained building. If
  positive, this is the maximum amount of power drained. If negative, this is
  the minimum amount of power drained. Defaults to 0.

  The start value is the victim building's Power, then the draining
  unit's Drain.Amount is applied, and finally the drained building's
  Drain.Amount.

For example: draining a Power Plant with Power=500 and
Drain.Amount=0 using a Floating Disk.

With Drain.Amount=-1000 on the disk, it will drain 1000, with
Drain.Amount=0 it will drain the 500 the building produces, and with
Drain.Amount=200 on the disk it will drain 200.

If the building would have Drain.Amount=-600, it would never drain less
than 600. If the building had Drain.Amount=800, it would never drain more
than 800.
