 Prerequisites; Reverse-Engineering logic

Reverse Engineer logic


In Red Alert 2, the Cloning Vats reverse-engineered any infantry it was
sent into. Ares not just re-enables this logic but also enables
customization.

[BuildingType]ReverseEngineersVictims=boolean
  Enables the reverse-engineering logic. Defaults to no.

 Currently Grinding=yes is needed to the reverse-engineering
  building to have this logic working. Also, reverse-engineered units will
  ignore Prerequisite, Prerequisite.Lists,
  PrerequisiteOverride, StolenTech, both old and new models,
  TechLevel, RequiredHouses and ForbiddenHouses, but
  obeying BuildLimit, Prerequisite.RequiredTheaters,
  Prerequisite.Negative, Factory and Naval settings.

 While this logic appears to be working, there have also been some
  minor bugs related to this feature. Be advised.

[InfantryOrVehicle]CanBeReversed=boolean
  Allows the unit to be reverse-engineered. Defaults to yes.
[InfantryOrVehicle]ReversedAs=TechnoType
  The optional type to override what a unit is reversed as. If not set, uses the
  actual unit type. Supports BuildingType\ s. Use none to
  reset. Defaults to none.

For a spy effect to reset a player's build options gained by reverse
engineering, see Spy Behavior.


When you are the owner of the reversing facility, reverse-engineering any
InfantryType for the first time will play
EVA_ReverseEngineeredInfantry and EVA_NewTechnologyAcquired;
reverse-engineering any VehicleType for the first time will play
EVA_ReverseEngineeredVehicle and EVA_NewTechnologyAcquired.
The undo-reversing spy effect will play EVA_TechnologyStolen.
