 Prerequisites; Reverse-Engineering logic

Reverse Engineer logic


In Red Alert 2, the Cloning Vats reverse-engineered any infantry it was
sent into. Ares not just re-enables this logic but also enables
customization.

[BuildingType]ReverseEngineersVictims=boolean
  Enables the reverse-engineering logic. Defaults to no.
[BuildingType]SpyEffect.UndoReverseEngineer=boolean
  Enables Spies to disable all reverse-engineered technology from that building.
  Defaults to no.
[InfantryOrVehicle]CanBeReversed=boolean
  Allows the unit to be reverse-engineered. Defaults to yes.

 Currently Grinding=yes is needed to the reverse-engineering
  building to have this logic working. Also, reverse-engineered units will
  ignore Prerequisite, Prerequisite.Lists,
  PrerequisiteOverride, StolenTech, both old and new models,
  TechLevel, RequiredHouses and ForbiddenHouses, but
  obeying BuildLimit, Prerequisite.RequiredTheaters,
  Prerequisite.Negative, Factory and Naval settings.

 While this logic appears to be working, there have also been some
  minor bugs related to this feature. Be advised.

When you are the owner of the reversing facility, reverse-engineering any
InfantryType for the first time will play
EVA_ReverseEngineeredInfantry and EVA_NewTechnologyAcquired;
reverse-engineering any VehicleType for the first time will play
EVA_ReverseEngineeredVehicle and EVA_NewTechnologyAcquired.
The undo-reversing spy effect will play EVA_TechnologyStolen.
