Disk Laser Animations


Even though pre-release screen shots showed this, DiskLaser=yes weapons
do not display animations from their warheads AnimList. Ares
automatically respects the Bright setting on the weapon and adds a way to
enable animations.

This global tag has to be enabled manually so the game's default is not changed,
because the Disk Laser weapons in Yuri's Revenge have animations set.

[AudioVisual]DiskLaserAnimEnabled=boolean
  Whether Disk Lasers should display an animation from their warhead's
  AnimList. Defaults to no.
