New Powered Unit Logic


In original Yuri's Revenge, the PowersUnit= tag logic dictated
that there could only be one powered UnitType, and one building
providing power, per side. Ares extends this with PoweredBy=,
which allows each side to have multiple buildings power multiple units.

[UnitType]PoweredBy=list of BuildingType
  Allows multiple powered units to exist, as well as allowing multiple buildings
  to provide power. Defaults to none.

 \ PoweredBy= can use multiple buildings, but be advised, using
  a comma to separate multiple buildings will be parsed as "or" rather than
  "and". There is no "and" capacity.
