AirRate


When a unit is moving, WalkRate is used to control the unit's animation,
when it is idle, IdleRate is used. A unit counted as idle if it wasn't
moving, which also included taking off, landing and hovering, and thus
helicopter style units would not play their rotor animation even if they clearly
were in air. Ares adds a new tag for this situation.

[TechnoType]AirRate=integer - number of frames
  If higher than 0, defines after how many frames the unit's animation
  is to be advanced to the next frame when the unit is in air. AirRate
  takes precedence over WalkRate and IdleRate. 0 disables
  AirRate. Defaults to 0.
