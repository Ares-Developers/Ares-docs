Forest Fires


Forest fires were a feature of Tiberian Sun. Trees were set on fire if
hit by a Sparky=yes warhead. While burning, they could ignite trees
nearby and thus over time spread like a wildfire.

Ares's implementation of forest fires slightly differs from the one in
Tiberian Sun. It is now required to also set the previously unused tag
IsFlammable=yes on each tree that may be set on fire. This is the only
noticeable change.

See Sparky on ModEnc  for a
more detailed description of the logic, and for the requirements to get it
working. To prevent crashes when firing a Sparky=yes warhead, do not
forget to set three valid animations as [AudioVisual]►OnFire and two valid
animations as [AudioVisual]►TreeFire.

 If trees are not burning down, make sure that the animation used as
  [AudioVisual]►SmallFire has Scorch=no set.
