Custom Animation and Projectile Palettes


In Yuri's Revenge, you could use the animation or the unit palette to
display animations. Ares lets you to specify custom palettes for
animations and projectiles.

[Animation]CustomPalette=filename with .pal extension
  Specifies the palette used to draw this animation/projectile.


You can specify theater-specific palettes by putting three  marks to the
theater specific part of the filename.  is replaced with the theater's
three-letter extension.

+ CustomPalette=abcd.pal always uses abcd.pal.
+ CustomPalette=lib.pal uses libtem.pal, libsno.pal,
  etc.

 Note that if you're using this on projectiles, you have to add the
  projectile to the [Animations]â–º list.
