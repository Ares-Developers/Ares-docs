When a unit is dropped onto the battlefield from a plane, with or without
parachute, these settings define how fast it will accelerate and how fast it
will fall at most.

  The acceleration towards the ground applied each frame a parachuted unit is
  falling. Defaults to 1.

[TechnoType]FallRate.NoParachute=integer
  The acceleration towards the ground applied each frame a unit without
  parachute is falling. Defaults to 1.

[TechnoType]FallRate.ParachuteMax=integer
  The maximum speed a parachuted unit is falling with. Value has to be negative.
  Defaults to [General]►ParachuteMaxFallRate.

[TechnoType]FallRate.NoParachuteMax=integer
  The maximum speed a unit without parachute is falling with. Value has to be
  negative. Defaults to [General]►NoParachuteMaxFallRate.
