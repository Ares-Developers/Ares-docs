Animation Damage


Using a Weapon


Instead of dealing damage directly using the Warhead, a weapon can be
defined to create a projectile and detonate it immediately. This allows some
weapon effects to be applied.

[Animation]Weapon=weapon
  The weapon used to deliver animation damage. If set, creates a projectile and
  detonates it immediately. The damage delivered is defined by the animation,
  not the weapon.

   The weapon has to be known to the game already, otherwise it cannot
    be parsed correctly. It is recommended to add it to the WeaponTypes
    list.

   Currently, the created projectile is neither owned by the player who
    created the animation nor the owner of the unit or structure the animation
    is attached to. While damage delivered using Warhead at least knows
    about the player who created the animation for scoring purposes, weapon
    damage does not pass on this information. This might change in the future.

Damage Delay


[Animation]Damage.Delay=integer - animation frames
  The delay between two applications of animation damage. Requires Damage
  greater than or equal to 1.0. A value of 0 disables the
  delay. Defaults to 0.

   Mind that this value is measured in animation frames: depending on
    Rate, the animation might not advance to the next animation frame
    every game frame.
