 Aircraft; ReloadRate per AircraftType

Aircraft-Specific ReloadRate


Aircraft only have a global tag for defining how long it takes to reload their
ammunition, which is difficult to balance for different types of aircraft firing
few powerful missiles and aircraft firing lots of weak machine gun rounds. In
Ares, each type can have its own ReloadRate.

[AircraftType]ReloadRate=double - minutes
  The interval between restoring one round of ammunition when docked to a
  UnitReload=yes building. Defaults to [General]â–ºReloadRate.

For this feature to work the reloading has also been changed to reload each
aircraft individually. This fixes the issue that reload times seemed to vary for
aircraft and the aircraft that landed first was reloaded substantially faster as
it required one less interval of ReloadRate.
