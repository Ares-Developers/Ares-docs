 Warheads; Nuke flash

Nuke Flash


The WarheadType called NUKE has hardcoded behavior to create a
map wide flash when detonating. This effect has been made customizable, so it
can be enabled for other warheads, too, or disabled for NUKE.

 Use this effect responsibly. Having overlapping effects does not
  work too well.

[Warhead]NukeFlash.Duration=integer - frames
  The number of frames the nuke flash fades in and stays fully active before it
  fades out again. A value of 0 disables the effect. Defaults to
  30 for NUKE, to 0 otherwise.
