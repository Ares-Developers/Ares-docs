Ion Cannon


Any warhead can launch an Ion Cannon effect in Ares. The Ion Cannon
consists of a beam and an impact animation on the ground as well as damage
delivery using a custom warhead.



  Warheads; Fire an Ion Cannon where the warhead impacts
  Ion Cannon; Fire from any warhead

Ion Cannon Blast


[Warhead]IonCannon=boolean
  Whether Ion Cannon logic will be activated when this warhead impacts. Defaults
  to no.

The following settings are available for Ion Cannon warheads.

[Warhead]IonCannon.Blast=Animation
  The optional first animation on the impact site. This is only used if the
  warhead impacts on land. If the impact site is on water, the last animation
  from the [CombatDamage]►SplashList is used. Set to none to
  deactivate. Defaults to [General]►IonBlast.

[Warhead]IonCannon.Beam=Animation
  The optional second animation on the impact site. Set to none to
  deactivate. Defaults to [General]►IonBeam.

[Warhead]IonCannon.Warhead=Warhead
  The optional warhead to deliver the damage. Set to none to deal no
  Ion Cannon damage. Defaults to [CombatDamage]►IonCannonWarhead.

[Warhead]IonCannon.Damage=integer - hitpoints
  The damage dealt by the Ion Cannon warhead. Defaults to
  [CombatDamage]►IonCannonDamage.

[Warhead]IonCannon.Rock=boolean
  Whether voxel units are rocked by the impact. Defaults to yes.

 Warheads; Ion Cannon ripple effect

Ripple Effect


The shockwave visual effect can be activated independently of a warhead being
an Ion Cannon.

[Warhead]IonCannon.Ripple=integer - frames
  This generates a visual shockwave when the warhead detonates, identical to the
  one produced by Tiberian Sun's Ion Cannon. Note that this is a visual
  effect only. Valid values range from 0 (off) to 79 (max
  effect). Defaults to 79 for IonCannon=yes, to 0
  otherwise.

  Below are listed some results of modifying the tag values.

  + IonCannon.Ripple=1 - Forget it, nothing.
  + IonCannon.Ripple=5 - Target cell, only voxel rippling
  + IonCannon.Ripple=8 - Target cell, both voxel and SHP rippling.
  + IonCannon.Ripple=10 - 1 cell radius
  + IonCannon.Ripple=15 - 2 cell radius
  + IonCannon.Ripple=20 - 3 cell radius
  + IonCannon.Ripple=25 - 3 cell radius
  + IonCannon.Ripple=28 - 3 cell unit-rippling, 4 cell terrain rippling
    radius
  + IonCannon.Ripple=30 and onwards - 3 cell unit-rippling, 5 cell
    terrain-rippling radius

 Warheads; Destroy bridges instantly

Bridge Destroyer


A hardcoded property of the original Ion Cannon from Tiberian Sun was
that it instantly destroyed bridges it hit. This special logic was only applied
for the warhead defined as IonCannonWarhead. With Ares, this
feature can be used on any warhead, and turned off for the original warhead.

[Warhead]BridgeAbsoluteDestroyer=boolean
  Whether this warhead immediately destroys a bridge it hits. Requires
  Wall=yes. Defaults to yes for
  [CombatDamage]►IonCannonWarhead, to no otherwise.
