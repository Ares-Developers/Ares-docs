Mechanical and Organic Warheads


Yuri's Revenge was hardcoded to only allow infantry to heal other
infantry and repair vehicles to only repair other vehicles. Ares removes
this hardcoding and now InfantryTypes and VehicleTypes can heal
or repair all TechnoTypes depending on verses. This allows creating
Mechanics as known from The Aftermath as well as Ambulances known from
Generals.

Ares supports the Guard Area action, which makes units follow and
protect a specific unit, as well as overriding heal by pressing the Force Move
keys, which allows units to enter damaged transporters.

 Aircraft docked on a helipad or airport cannot be repaired by
  vehicles. This mimics the original behavior. This limitation has not been
  recreated for infantry. This might be changed in the future.
