Warhead Effects


The effects KillDriver, Sonar, Disable Weapon and Flashing can be applied
independently of conventional damage.

[Warhead]EffectsRequireDamage=boolean
  Whether warheads will only apply the effects if at least one hitpoint of
  damage has actually been dealt to a unit or structure. If no, effects
  are also applied if the no damage is dealt. Requires positive damage; healing
  does not use this setting. Defaults to no.

[Warhead]EffectsRequireVerses=boolean
  Whether Verses needs to be greater than 0% for the warhead to
  apply effects. Can be used to distinguish between 0% and greater
  verses that potentially nullify damage, between immunity and vulnerability. If
  no, effects are applied to any unit or structure regardless of
  verses. Defaults to yes.

 Warheads; No conventional damage

Non-Damaging Warheads


This can be used to punctually disable an optimization in the game to still
apply warhead effects without doing damage. By default, Yuri's Revenge
checks whether no damage is to be dealt before expensively determining which
units and structures are in range.

[Warhead]AllowZeroDamage=boolean
  Whether damage of 0 hitpoints will still be passed on to all units and
  structures affected by the warhead. Otherwise, a damage of 0 will not be
  passed on. Defaults to no.

  Warheads; Suppress EVA's "Ore miner under attack" warnings
  EVA; Suppress "Ore miner under attack" warnings per warhead

Non-Malicious Warheads


[Warhead]Malicious=boolean
  Specifies whether or not EVA should notify an ore miner's owner of an attack
  (EVA_OreMinerUnderAttack). No other EVA messages are suppressed. For
  example, if a warhead's purpose is to spread ore dealing damage as a side
  effect only you can use Malicious=no to disable unreasonable EVA attack
  warnings for ore miners. Defaults to yes.

 0.2


Prevent scattering


A unit hit by a warhead might scatter on impact. This tag on the attacking
warhead prevents this.

[Warhead]PreventScatter=boolean
  Whether units should not scatter when attacked with this warhead even if they
  have the ability to. Defaults to no.
