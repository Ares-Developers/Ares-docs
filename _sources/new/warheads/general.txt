Non-Malicious Warheads


[Warhead]Malicious=boolean
  Specifies whether or not EVA should notify a ore miner's owner of an attack
  (EVA_OreMinerUnderAttack). No other EVA messages are suppressed. For
  example, if a warhead's purpose is to spread ore dealing damage as a side
  effect only you can use Malicious=no to disable unreasonable EVA attack
  warnings for ore miners. Defaults to yes.

 Warheads; Malicious= warhead flag suppresses EVA's *ore miner under
  attack* warnings.

A unit hit by a warhead might scatter on impact. This tag on the attacking
warhead prevents this.

  have the ability to. Defaults to no.
