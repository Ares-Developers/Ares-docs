Deployed Infantry Damage multiplier


[Warhead]Damage.Deployed=float - multiplier
  A multiplier applied to Damage if the InfantryType receiving it
  is currently deployed.


Note that this is not the same as the existing ProneDamage= flag;
deployed units are not considered to be prone. Defaults to 100%.

 Warheads; Per-warhead damage multiplier against deployed infantry.

InfDeathAnim


[Warhead]InfDeathAnim=string, animation ID
  Specifies the animation to display when an InfantryType (with
  NotHuman=no) is killed by this warhead. Works in the same way as
  existing InfDeath animations except this flag allows you to specify an
  animation ID rather than an integer. Further more, the animation will be
  treated as the correct type (e.g. mutation or non-mutation) automatically,
  which means that you can now have any number of mutations that produce
  player-owned InfantryTypes. See MakeInfantryOwner for how to control which player will gain control of
  'mutated' infantry.

 Warheads; New InfDeaths (InfDeathAnim= any animation, auto-detect mutation).
