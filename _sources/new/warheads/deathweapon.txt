 Warheads; Suppress death weapons

Suppress Death Weapons


With these tags certain warheads can be made to not trigger death weapons of
units specified by a list of types, or to generally not trigger death weapons
for infantry or vehicle units. All tags only apply if the warhead kills a unit,
not when the unit is merely damaged and later killed by some other warhead.

[Warhead]DeathWeapon.Suppress=list of TechnoTypes
  When this warhead causes the death of a unit from this list, its death weapon
  will not fire.

[Warhead]DeathWeapon.SuppressVehicles=boolean
  Whether death weapons of all VehicleTypes are suppressed when this
  warhead kills. If no, DeathWeapon.Suppress is still checked.
  Defaults to no.

[Warhead]DeathWeapon.SuppressInfantry=boolean
  Whether death weapons of all InfantryTypes are suppressed when this
  warhead kills. If no, DeathWeapon.Suppress is still checked.
  Defaults to no.
