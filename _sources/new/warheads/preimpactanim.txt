 Warheads; Pre-impact anim not just for nukes

PreImpactAnim


In Yuri's Revenge the nuke uses a special animation called
NUKEBALL which was shown prior to displaying the actual mushroom
explosion and dealing damage. The game was hard-coded to use this only for
warheads with the ID NUKE. Ares enables this for arbitrary
warheads.

[Warhead]PreImpactAnim=string, animation ID
  Specifies the animation to display when a projectile which uses this warhead
  impacts. After the animation is over, the actual explosion is created and
  damage is dealt. The animation may not be looping. Defaults to
  NUKEBALL for NUKE, otherwise to none.
