 Warheads; Override die sounds and voices

Override Die Sounds and Voices


When killing units using this warhead, the die sounds and voices can be
overridden to not give owning players a clue that their units are under attack,
or to disable these sounds for warheads that should not be considered killing
units like Make Infantry conversions.
