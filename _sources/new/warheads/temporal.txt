Consider Health


[Warhead]Temporal.HealthFactor=float - multiplier
  How much the health of the victim is factored in into the remaining warp value
  of the target. Valid values range from 0.0 to 1.0 inclusive.
  0.0 means health plays no role. 1.0 means the remaining warp
  is reduced proportionally to the target's health, down to 0. Defaults to
  0.0.

   Another way to look at it is that the remaining warp value is
    linearly decreased from full for completely healthy targets down by this
    value for a target that has no health left.
