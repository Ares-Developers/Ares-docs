 Warheads; MAD Tank style relative damage

MAD Tank Style Relative Damage


This logic is inspired by the MAD Tank known from the Red Alert mission
disk The Aftermath, where it was used as a large area of effect weapon
that damaged each victim by taking away a share of its health.

Instead of using a fixed damage value, a value relative to the victim's
Strength or current health can be dealt by a warhead. Country armor
multipliers and veterancy bonuses are still applied, as well as Verses.

Relative Damage is not supported on special weapon logics like Temporal
or Psychedelic warheads, and also doesn't support ProneDamage and
DeployedDamage for infantry. Suppressing parasites is also not supported.

[Warhead]RelativeDamage=boolean
  Deal damage relative to Strength or current health instead of
  dealing conventional damage. If set to yes, the four tags below are
  used depending on target type. If a tag is not defined, no damage is dealt.
  Defaults to no.

   A dummy Damage is needed on this warhead for targeting, even
    though finally the value is not used. If Damage is negative (like for
    healing weapons), the Relative Damage will be negative also.

[Warhead]RelativeDamage.Buildings=integer - percent

[Warhead]RelativeDamage.Aircraft=integer - percent

[Warhead]RelativeDamage.Infantry=integer - percent

[Warhead]RelativeDamage.Vehicles=integer - percent
  The damage defined as percentage from either Strength, if positive, or
  current health, if negative. Supported values range from -100 to
  100. A value of 0 deals no damage. Defaults to 0.

Relative Damage considers Organic=yes vehicles as infantry and
ConsideredAircraft=yes vehicles as aircraft.
