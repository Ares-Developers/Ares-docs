Reloading Time Modifier


Units under the effect of Chaos Gas or other Psychedelic=yes warheads go
berserk, which reduces their willingness to obey orders as well as their
reloading time. This reloading time factor can be customized globally and for
each TechnoType.

[CombatDamage]BerserkROFMultiplier=float - multiplier
  The multiplier applied to the reloading time when a unit is berserking.
  Smaller means shorter reloading and faster firing. Defaults to 0.5.

[TechnoType]Berserk.ROFMultiplier=float - multiplier
  The multiplier applied when this unit is berserking. Smaller means faster
  firing. Defaults to [CombatDamage]►BerserkROFMultiplier.

Immunity to Berserk


The tag ImmuneToPsionics is determines whether a unit or structure is
susceptible to mind control and Psychedelic=yes weapons. If the object is
immune to one, it is immune to the other. Ares allows to differentiate.

[TechnoType]ImmuneToBerserk=boolean
  Whether this object is immune to berserking, the Chaos Gas effect. Can be used
  to override ImmuneToPsionics and the PSIONICSIMMUNE ability. If set to
  yes, the object is not affected by Chaos Gas even if not
  ImmuneToPsionics=yes; if set to no, the object can be affected
  by Chaos Gas despite maybe being immune to psionics.

  If not set, acts as if set to yes if ImmuneToPsionics=yes or
  the object gained the PSIONICSIMMUNE ability through veterancy,
  otherwise as if set to no.

   Currently, the default of not being set cannot be restored once this
    tag has been set.
