Iron Curtain Effect


The Iron Curtain effect can now be given to or removed from units and buildings
using new Ares warhead settings.

[Warhead]IronCurtain.Duration=integer - frames
  If positive, endows the target unit with the Iron Curtain effect for the
  specified number of frames. If negative, the Iron Curtain effect duration will
  be reduced by this number of frames. Use IronCurtain.Cap= below to have
  the effect duration be cumulative rather than absolute.
  IronCurtain.Duration defaults to 0 (no Iron Curtain effect).
[Warhead]IronCurtain.Cap=integer
  If this value is negative the IronCurtain.Duration is absolute and will
  not stack up if a target is fired upon multiple times. If this value is
  0 the effect duration can stack up indefinitely. Otherwise the Iron
  Curtain effect cannot stack up to durations longer than this value -- except
  for when a unit's duration already is higher and IronCurtain.Duration
  isn't negative (the duration will not be decreased, then).
  IronCurtain.Cap defaults to -1 (non-stacking, absolute
  duration).


To change the effect the Iron Curtain has on specific units:

[TechnoType]IronCurtain.Modifier=float - multiplier
  If the Iron Curtain effect duration is positive it will be multiplied by this
  factor. Use 0% to create a unit that cannot be affected by the Iron
  Curtain. IronCurtain.Modifier defaults to 100%.

 To have a unit protect a target for ten seconds, set
  [Warhead]►IronCurtain.Duration=150. To allow the Iron Curtain duration
  to stack up to one minute, set [Warhead]►IronCurtain.Cap=900. To remove
  the Iron Curtain effect altogether, set
  [Warhead]►IronCurtain.Duration=-1 and
  [Warhead]►IronCurtain.Cap=0 (remove one frame but have the resulting
  number of frames not exceed 0).

If a weapon deals conventional damage and applies the Iron Curtain at the same
time, the damage will be dealt first. InfantryTypes and
Organic=yes units will always get killed instantaneously.

This feature works with CellSpread to affect multiple targets.
AffectsAllies and AffectsEnemies are respected. A unit does not
get the Iron Curtain effect if Verses is equal to 0%, otherwise
the target is endowed with the full effect.
