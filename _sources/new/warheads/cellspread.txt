CellSpread Enhancements

CellSpread


Yuri's Revenge used a lookup table to iterate all the cells affected by
area of effect weapons using CellSpread. This lookup table was limited
because it only supported a maximum range of 11 (which contained errors).

Ares replaces this lookup table and makes it possible to use larger
values for CellSpread. All area of effect weapon features Ares
added (like AttachEffects on Warheads,
EMP, IronCurtain on Weapons)
have been updated to support this as well.

 Consider: If you double the range, the number of affected cells is
  quadrupled. For performance reasons it is not advised to use CellSpread
  for frequent or map wide effects.

CellSpread Hit Limit


The CellSpread logic iterates all cells in range, and affects all objects
on these cells. If an object occupies more than one cell like buildings with a
foundation larger than 1x1, it could be encountered multiple times and thus
would take multiple hits (potentially one for each cell of its foundation).

The following tag limits the number of times the same object can be hit by the
same cause. If an object is hit more often than allowed, the hits closest to the
impact site are used, all others are discarded.

[Warhead]CellSpread.MaxAffect=integer
  The number of times an object can be affected at most when hit by a warhead
  using CellSpread. Set this to 1 to make the same object not be
  hit not more than once. Defaults to -1 (infinite).
