Culling


With Ares the culling effect used by naval parasites like Squids can
also be applied to conventional warheads. Culling is responsibile for dealing a
deadly blow once the victim is below a certain health percentage.

[Warhead]Culling.RookieBelowHealth=integer - percentage

[Warhead]Culling.VeteranBelowHealth=integer - percentage

[Warhead]Culling.EliteBelowHealth=integer - percentage
  The health a victim unit must fall below to be culled by a hit using this
  warhead. Use 1 to 100 to represent percentages of full
  health; use 0, -1, and -2 to represent health
  states critical/red, damaged/yellow, and healthy/green respectively.
  Requires Culling=yes.

  Defaults to 0 for Culling.RookieBelowHealth and
  Culling.VeteranBelowHealth, to -1 for
  Culling.EliteBelowHealth.

  The default is the behavior of parasites with Culling=yes: They cull
  units with critical health if the firer is rookie or veteran, and also cull
  damaged units (yellow) if firer is elite.


[Warhead]Culling.Chance=integer - percentage

[Warhead]Culling.RookieChance=integer - percentage

[Warhead]Culling.VeteranChance=integer - percentage

[Warhead]Culling.EliteChance=integer - percentage
  The chance that a cullable unit is actually culled by a hit using this
  warhead. Requires Culling=yes. Defaults to 100 (always).

  Use Culling.Chance to set the chance for all veterancy levels.

   This chance is applied every time damage is dealt using this
    warhead, not once per victim. That means with 70 there is a 70%
    chance of culling on the first hit, and a 91% chance of culling the unit
    on the second hit.
