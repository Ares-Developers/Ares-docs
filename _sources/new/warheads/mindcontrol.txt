Permanent Mind-Control


[Warhead]MindControl.Permanent=boolean
  If the warhead has MindControl.Permanent=yes set as well as
  MindControl=yes set then the mind-control will be permanent.

Permanent mind-control is handled in the same way as the Psychic Dominator
effect -- previously-mind-controlled units (even permanently) are
re-mind-controlled, and the mind-controller does not have a limit on the number
of units that it can permanently mind-control.

Unlike the Psychic Dominator, buildings are susceptible to permanent
mind-control if the warhead can target them.
