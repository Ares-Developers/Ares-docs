 Warheads; Disable weapons temporarily

Disable Weapons


This warhead effect can be used to temporarily jam the target unit, so it will
not be able to fire its weapons. It will still be able to reload, target a
victim and even passively acquire new targets, and death weapons will still be
set off when the target is killed or destroyed. Also note that special effects
like C4 are not disabled.

Whether this effect is applied when no conventional damage is dealt can be
customized. See ....

[Warhead]DisableWeapons.Duration=integer - frames
