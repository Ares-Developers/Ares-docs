Suppress Unit Lost Message


When a unit is killed, EVA notifies the owning player about this. To kill units
silently or to create mutation weapons where killing the unit is actually not to
be considered killing, this message can be suppressed for a warhead.

[Warhead]UnitLost.Suppress=boolean
  Whether units killed by this warhead should not play the Unit Lost EVA
  message. Damaging  units without killing them using this warhead will not
  silence the message. Defaults to no.
