 Warheads; Damage or don't damage units in the air

Damage Airborne Units


Warheads detonating on the ground cause explosions that never affect units in
the air, no matter how large the CellSpead range is. If a warhead
detonated just a few leptons above the ground however, airborne units would be
affected if they were in range. This can now be changed.

[Warhead]DamageAirThreshold=integer - leptons
  If the warhead detonates *more* than this many leptons above the ground, units
  in the air will be affected. Otherwise, units in the air are not damaged.
  Defaults to 0.

   Use -1 to damage even air units when the warhead
    detonates on the ground, or a high positive value like 9999 to
    disable damaging air units despite the warhead detonating in air.

[General]DamageAirConsiderBridges=boolean
  Whether a warhead detonating above a bridge will consider the bridge's height
  for finding out whether units in air are to be damaged. Defaults to
  no.

  If no, a warhead detonating on a bridge will be considered to be four
  levels (416 leptons) high in the air, if yes, it will be 0 leptons
  above the ground and thus by default not trigger damaging units in the air.
