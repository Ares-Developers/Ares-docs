 Spawners; Support cloaking spawners

Spawners


Spawners have been enhanced to support cloak. A cloaking Destroyer or Aircraft
Carrier will not cause all its spawns to self-destruct any more. Spawners now
have rudimentary support for BalloonHover=yes.


 Spawners; Flying Aircraft Carriers

Flying Aircraft Carriers


Non-Missile spawns were always put on the ground for take-off, even if the
carrier was in the air. This has been changed and spawns now start from the
carrier.

Spawned units now return to BalloonHover=yes spawners, instead of flying
off the map and potentially crashing the game. If the spawner unit is moving, it
is possible that the spawns lower on the wrong cell and then gain altitude
again.

For best effects, the FlightLevel of spawns should be higher than the
FlightLevel of the spawning unit. Otherwise the spawns would disappear
from mid-air when docking, or even try to lower down to the ground instead of
going up to the carrier.

 Please note that this logics still has some shortcomings and it has
  many opportunities for improvements. For example, move sounds do not work
  correctly once a spawn has launched once.
