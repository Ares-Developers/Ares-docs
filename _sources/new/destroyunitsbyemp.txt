Destroy Units by EMP


Certain units should be destroyed by EMP rather than just being paralyzed.
Aircraft is destroyed by EMP instantaneously, but flying TechnoTypes
like the Siege Chopper, Kirov and Yuri's Disk do not count as Aircraft.
EMP.Threshold changes this behavior. EMP.Threshold defaults to
inair, destroying all TechnoTypes that are in the air the
instant the EMP hits. Parachuting TechnoTypes do not count as being in
the air, yet exceeding the positive threshold will kill them, too.

[TechnoType]EMP.Threshold=enumeration - one of yes|no|inair *or* integer - frames
  Specifies whether or not the TechnoType will be destroyed by EMP
  weapons. Use an integer to set the exact EMP duration this unit has to exceed
  to get destroyed.

    + Positive values will destroy the unit if the number of EMP frames exceeds
      this value. yes equals 1.
    + Negative values will destroy the unit only if is currently in-air.
      inair equals -1.
    + A value of zero will disable this feature. no equals 0.


You can both create units that only take a certain amount of EMP before failing
irrecoverably as well as flying and floating units that just crash like
aircraft.

Using inair causes the Siege Chopper not to be destroyed when it is
deployed. Using -100 will crash the Siege Chopper only if it is in-air
and it accumulates an EMP duration of more than 100 frames.
