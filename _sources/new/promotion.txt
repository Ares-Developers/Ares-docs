Global VeteranFlashTimer


Yuri's Revenge allowed units to flash only when they were promoted to
elite veterancy. Ares adds a new global tag that works like
EliteFlashTimer.

[AudioVisual]VeteranFlashTimer=integer - frames
  The number of frames a newly veteran unit or structure will flash for.
  Defaults to 0.

  Veterancy; Promote passengers as if they are part of the transport

Promote all Passengers


The following setting can be used on OpenTopped=yes transports with
Initial Payload, which are used to imitate multiple weapons but logically only
count as one unit. This works best with Experience.PromotePassengers=no
and optionally Experience.FromPassengers=yes.

This does not forward "experience" as the ratio of a destroyed object's cost and
the own cost. Instead, this forwards the "rank" like veteran and elite. A
Guardian GI inside a Battle Fortress will always mirror the transport's rank,
despite being much cheaper than the vehicle and thus usually promoted earlier. 

[TechnoType]Promote.IncludePassengers=boolean
  Whether all Trainable=yes passengers will be set to the same rank if
  the rank of this transport unit changes. Defaults to no.

   The passengers' veterancy is discarded when the vehicle is promoted.
    This should not be used on manually controllable transports, because they
    could degrade elite passengers to veterans, for example.
