Specific Passengers


Additionally to the checks for Size and SizeLimit, it is possible
to allow passengers to enter depending on their type.

[TechnoType]Passengers.Allowed=list of TechnoTypes
  The list of allowed passenger types. If this contains at least one type, all
  other types are not allowed to enter this object. If you want to prevent all
  units from entering, set this to either a dummy unit or a
  BuildingType.

[TechnoType]Passengers.Disallowed=list of TechnoTypes
  The list of types that are not allowed to enter this object.

Ignoring Passenger Size


Transports can ignore the actual size of its passengers and use up one slot for
each only.

[UnitType]Passengers.BySize=boolean
  Whether passengers will take up as much space in the cargo hold as their
  Size instead of taking up only one seat no matter the size of the
  object. If no, the transport can always contain up to
  Passengers units. Defaults to yes.

   SizeLimit is always respected. A too large unit will still
    not be able to enter.
