Gates


Gates are buildings that are passable for allies but act like a wall for
enemies. Introduced in Tiberian Sun, they were not featured prominently
in the later games. They still work, and Ares makes some of their
options customizable.

 Mind the naming scheme from Tiberian Sun, which made sense
  when gates lowered into the ground: *down* means **opening**, *up* means
  **closing**.
