 AI; Team retaliates if a member is attacked

Team Retaliate


If a unit attacked a member of an idling team in Tiberian Sun and didn't
kill it right away, the team would collectively retaliate against the offender.
This logic has been removed from Red Alert 2 and Ares brings it
back as an optional feature.

While the original logic just ignored AircraftTypes, the restored logic
also excludes ConsideredAircraft=yes units and parasites. Another
difference is that the team members' current targets are no longer reset when a
second offender attacks the team, which might prevent target juggling in case of
multiple attackers.

This feature can only be enabled globally using a tag to not change the original
game's behavior. Also, Ares does not extend TeamTypes yet to
allow custom tags per team.

[General]TeamRetaliate=boolean
  Whether teams are allowed to retaliate if a member is attacked and not killed
  immediately. Defaults to no.
