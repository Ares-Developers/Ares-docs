 Animations; Napalm tags Scorch= and Flamer= restored

Scorch and Flamer


Tiberian Sun had special support for napalm animations: two tags that
spawned new fire animations defined by SmallFire and LargeFire.
This has been reimplemented as it worked previously.

There is one notable change in behavior compared to Tiberian Sun: If
LargeFire or SmallFire are not set correctly, the game will not
crash when a new animation of these types is about to be created.

[Animation]Scorch=boolean
  Whether a new [AudioVisual]►SmallFire animation should be attached to
  the same object this animation is attached to when expiring. Does not spawn on
  water, beach, ice, or rock terrain. For a complete description of behavior and
  requirements, refer to Scorch on ModEnc
   Defaults to no.

   Do not set Scorch=yes on [AudioVisual]►SmallFire,
    because this would create a loop: if the animation expires, a new animation
    of the same type is created and attached to the same object. It also causes
    trees on fire to never burn down.

[Animation]Flamer=boolean
  Whether new [AudioVisual]►SmallFire and [AudioVisual]►LargeFire
  animations should be randomly created close to the location of this animation
  when expiring. For a complete description of behavior and requirements, refer
  to Flamer on ModEnc .
  Defaults to no.
