Gunner IFVs


Gunner=yes units support changing their weapon depending on their first
passenger. While it was quite versatile for players and while it supported some
customization for modders, this logic added in Red Alert 2 was rather
rigidly hardcoded internally. Ares changes this.

Multiple IFVs


The [FV]► was the only unit to be checked for the special turret and
weapon flags, such as SniperTurretIndex. With Ares, all
VehicleTypes with Gunner=yes set will read those flags. This
means that you can now have multiple types of IFV.

  Turrets; More than 18 weapons and turrets

More Turrets and Weapons


Ares supports more than 18 different turret and barrel voxels, which
means TurretCount now can be set to values greater than 18.
TurretCount values greater than 127 are not supported, though.

Also, units having multiple turrets enabled by the use of TurretCount
have been expanded to support more than 18 weapons along with their elite
counterparts, thus more than 18 different IFVMode\ s are now possible.

Defining IFV Modes


Ares replaces the original parsing of the tags mapping weapons to
turrets like InitiateWeaponIndex and InitiateTurretIndex. No
longer are the values applied even though the weapon index is -1 (which
is the default and which usually resulted in corruptions and crashes).
Gunner=yes units will not change properties if their section is defined
for example in a map file without restating all those mappings.

For the additional IFVMode\ s Ares adds an alternative way to
define which turret to use for which weapon using a single tag each. Also, a
warning message is put into the debug log if an index is set to an invalid
value.

[TechnoType]WeaponTurretIndexX=integer - turret index
  The turret index used when WeaponX and EliteWeaponX are active,
  defined by IFVMode on the passenger. X is the number from
  1 to WeaponCount. Defaults to -1.

   Note that WeaponX is 1-based while IFVMode is 0-based.
    For example IFVMode=4 activates Weapon5 and uses the turret
    index set as WeaponTurretIndex5.

Optionally, the Gunner=yes unit can have its own custom tool tip text for
each active weapon, which can be set using the following tags.

Note that this is different from the original game's approach which focused on
the active turret index to determine what name to show. The game used hardcoded
labels for certain turrets and could also merge the final tool tip from the
passenger type's name and the transport's name.

[TechnoType]WeaponUINameX=CSF label
  If set, is used as tool tip for this Gunner=yes unit if weapon
  X is active. X is the number from 1 to
  WeaponCount. If not set, defaults to the original behavior.

VoiceIFVRepair


In Ares you can specify the VoiceIFVRepair tag on any IFV unit.

[VehicleType]VoiceIFVRepair=soundmd entry
  Specifies the response this IFV gives when ordered to repair something. If
  this value is not set, [VehicleType]►VoiceAttack is used. Defaults to 
  [AudioVisual]►VoiceIFVRepair for [FV]►, otherwise to
  none.
