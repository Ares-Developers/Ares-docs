 EVA; Create new EVA announcers

EVA Types


Ares supports defining new EVA voice types in addition to the three
announcers for the original sides. You can add as many new types as you like.

All new EVA types have to be named in the new [EVATypes] list in
evamd.ini. This is a list like every other list, that is, the part left
of the equal sign is ignored. The original voices called Allied,
Russian and Yuri are added by default.

  ::

    [EVATypes]
    0=GDI
    1=Cabal

Now, these names can be used as keys in the EVA sound sections to point to an
EVA-specific filename. Filenames can have a length of up to eight characters. If
you don't specify a filename for an EVA Type, no sound will play.

  ::

    [EVA_LowPower]
    Cabal=ccab053
    GDI=cgdi053

Now you are ready to use this new EVA Type. See EVA.Tag for Sides.
