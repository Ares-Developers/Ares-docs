Carryalls


Carryalls were a feature of Tiberian Sun. AircraftTypes with
Carryall=yes could pick up UnitTypes from the battlefield, carry
them around the map and place them anywhere. The carryall logic was not used in
Red Alert 2 and was not updated for naval units and other new features.
Ares updates the logic and adds new options.

If a unit can be picked up, the cursor named Tote is shown. See how to
customize this Mouse Cursor.

[AircraftType]Carryall.SizeLimit=integer
  The maximum Size= that this carryall can lift. Use -1 to allow
  any size. Defaults to -1.

[UnitType]Carryall.Allowed=boolean
  Can this unit be picked up by a carryall? If not set, Organic=yes and
  NonVehicle=yes units cannot be picked up. If specified,
  Carryall.Allowed overrules those considerations. Currently it is not
  possible to "unset" this tag to use the default again. You have to set it
  explicitly.
  
   Units infected with a Parasite (Terror Drone/Squid) cannot be picked
    up.

 For the Carryall to work it must have AirportBound=no and no
  Dock= set, otherwise they will be unable to pick up units.

 By default, carryalls can pick up vessels, which are UnitTypes
  with Naval=yes set, but they cannot be placed back on water again. If a
  ship is placed on ground, it will explode and take the carryall with it. To
  prevent this, set Carryall.Allowed=no on the ship.
