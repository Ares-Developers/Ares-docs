 Foundations; Buildings can have any size and shape

Custom Building Foundations


Building Foundations can now be any shape and size, not just the few predefined
options previously available. For example, you can now recreate the old
Red Alert Repair Depot foundation. The INI coding is rather complex, so
instead of writing it manually, it's recommended to use the Custom
Foundation Generator </extras/custom_foundation.html> developed by Renegade.

When creating foundations, don't forget to create the outlines.

 War Factories are hard-coded to use the unit exit paths from the
  original game so changing the foundation for these buildings is not
  recommended. The preferred exit point for a unit exiting a War Factory
  is hard-coded to be the 11th cell of the Outline.

 The Custom Foundation Generator located with the Renegade Project
  Network is incompatible with Google Chrome, and results in gibberish.
  Be advised.
