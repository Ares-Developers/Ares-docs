Factories and Cloning


Different factories for units (Kennels)


[InfantryOrVehicle]BuiltAt=list of BuildingTypes
  Units will be kicked out of the first not-busy building the house owns that is
  mentioned in this list. If no BuildingType is set, all factories that
  can produce this unit will be checked. Defaults to none.

[BuildingType]Factory.ExplicitOnly=boolean
  Set this to yes to only allow this factory to produce units that
  explicitly mention this BuildingType in their BuiltAt list.
  Units with empty BuiltAt lists will not be built here. The effect is
  the same as stating BuiltAt lists on every unit, omitting all factories
  that have this tag set. Defaults to no.

   To recreate the dog from Red Alert that is trained in
    a kennel, set [KENN]►Factory=InfantryType,
    [KENN]►Factory.ExplicitOnly=yes, [DOG]►BuiltAt=KENN and update
    the [DOG]►Prerequisite to contain [KENN]►.


"Cloning Vats" for VehicleTypes


[BuildingType]CloningFacility=boolean
  Defines whether this building will clone all VehicleTypes with the
  same Naval setting as itself that are Cloneable=yes and
  ClonedAt=none. This is the VehicleType version of the Cloning
  Vats. Defaults to no.


Cloning options


[InfantryOrVehicle]Cloneable=boolean
  Whether or not this infantry or unit can be cloned by Cloning=yes,
  CloningFacility=yes or their respective ClonedAt buildings.
  Defaults to yes.

[InfantryOrVehicle]ClonedAt=list of BuildingTypes
  Each building of the types mentioned in the list owned by the same house will
  kick out an extra clone of this object for free. If a building is blocked, the
  player will get no refunds. Defaults to none.

   Cloning will ignore buildings with Factory= set. Note that
    Factory is not what causes the units to walk or drive out properly,
    WeaponsFactory=yes, GDIBarracks=yes, NODBarracks=yes
    and YuriBarracks=yes are.

   If ClonedAt is specified, neither Cloning=yes nor
    CloningFacility=yes will clone the object.


 Factories; Build units from certain factories only.
