 Prism; Extended Prism networks ("Prism Forwarding")

Prism Forwarding


In this pre-release screenshot for Red Alert 2, Prism Towers are seen to
feed their energy from one tower to another along a whole chain of towers. This,
of course, is not possible in the released game (which suggests that this
screenshot has been doctored).

Ares completely replaces the old Prism Tower code to fix a couple of
minor bugs and also extend it to provide a full set of Prism networking options.

 0.2

 If all you want to do is keep existing Prism Towers but extend
  them to multiple chains like in the pre-release screenshot above, simply set
  [ATESLA]►PrismForwarding.MaxChainLength=3 or the number of
  backward-links you would like (-1 for infinite).

[BuildingType]PrismForwarding=enumeration - yes|no|forward|attack
  Specifies whether or not this building is a Prism Tower.

    + PrismForwarding=forward means that this building can support other
      towers but cannot attack as a Prism Tower.
    + PrismForwarding=attack means that this building can attack as a 
      Prism Tower but cannot support other towers.
    + PrismForwarding=yes means that this building is a fully fledged
      Prism Tower - it can support other towers or attack.
    + PrismForwarding=no means that this building is not a Prism Tower
      and will not be included in any prism networks.

  Defaults to yes for the building specified by
  [General]►PrismType, defaults to no for all other buildings.

[BuildingType]PrismForwarding.Targets=list of BuildingTypes
  The list of BuildingTypes that this tower can support. Defaults to
  just the building type itself, although don't forget to mention the building
  itself if you decide to include this flag.

[BuildingType]PrismForwarding.MaxFeeds=integer
  The maximum number of slave (support) towers that can feed directly into this
  one (i.e. adjacent towers). -1 means no limit. Defaults to
  [General]►PrismSupportMax.

[BuildingType]PrismForwarding.MaxChainLength=integer
  The maximum number of backward links that can precede this tower. -1
  means no limit. Default is 1.

  In order to achieve what is shown in the pre-release screenshot above, you
  would need to set this to at least 3.

[BuildingType]PrismForwarding.MaxNetworkSize=integer
  If this is the firing tower then PrismForwarding.MaxNetworkSize is the
  total number of towers allowed in the prism network, not including the firing
  tower itself. Only the firing tower dictates the maximum network size,
  regardless of what other tower types may be included in the network.
  -1 means no limit. Defaults to [General]►PrismSupportMax.

[BuildingType]PrismForwarding.SupportModifier=float - multiplier
  This works in the same way as the old PrismSupportModifier - it is the
  amount of multiplier that this tower will contribute to the firing beam. The
  multiplier accumulates in a linear fashion (i.e. if there are 2 support
  towers, each with PrismForwarding.SupportModifier=150%, then the total
  multiplier to damage will be `150% + 150% + 100% = 400%`. Defaults to
  [General]►PrismSupportModifier.

[BuildingType]PrismForwarding.DamageAdd=integer - damage bonus
  A flat damage bonus added to the firing beam before the
  PrismForwarding.SupportModifier multiplier is applied. This can be used
  instead of the multiplier, or it can be used in conjunction with the
  multiplier to progressively dial up or down the final damage as more towers
  are included in the network. Defaults to 0.

   You will need to limit the number of towers in the network if
    dialing down the damage bonus, otherwise the firing beam may end up becoming
    a healing weapon.
    
  You can input your own values into the Prism Forwarding spreadsheet
  </extras/PrismForwarding.xls> to see the effect this has on the damage
  dealt by your prism networks.

[BuildingType]PrismForwarding.MyHeight=integer - leptons
  The height (in leptons) at which this tower's "prism receiver" is considered
  to be, so that support towers know where to aim their support beams. Defaults
  to [General]►PrismSupportHeight.

[BuildingType]PrismForwarding.ToAllies=boolean
  Whether or not this Prism Tower is allowed to support allied towers. Defaults
  to no.

  Note that, in long-chain prism networks, this tower must be allied with the
  firing tower as well as the target tower.

[BuildingType]PrismForwarding.BreakSupport=boolean
  Whether or not this Prism Tower can abort supporting another tower at the last
  moment, in order to become a master (firing) tower instead. If a tower does
  break support, it does not need to restart charging. Defaults to no.

[BuildingType]PrismForwarding.ChargeDelay=integer - frames

   This is for advanced users only!
  
  This option was only really added for testing purposes and doesn't really
  enhance the look of the support beam so it is recommended that you ignore this
  option. In the original game, the master (firing) tower enlists just one slave
  (support) tower per frame. Each slave tower enlisted begins charging at that
  time and the master tower restarts charging. This gives the effect of having
  the slave tower beams arrive in quick succession, rather than all at once.
  This effect is barely noticeable in-game except at slow speeds or if the
  network has a large number of towers.
  
  In Ares, this has been changed so that all adjacent slave towers are
  enlisted on the same frame. That said, a charge delay has been introduced so
  that the towers do not all appear to start charging immediately. For each
  backward-chain in the network, the farthest-forward towers begin charging just
  that little bit later, to give the effect of the beam travelling along the
  chain. The amount that each tower will delay starting its charge for can be
  specified by PrismForwarding.ChargeDelay. This delay accumulates for
  each chain in the prism forwarding network.

  So, for example, if PrismForwarding.ChargeDelay=2 and you have a prism
  chain of 3 towers then the farthest tower (tower 3) will begin charging
  immediately, the middle tower (tower 2) will begin charging after 2 frames and
  the firing tower (tower 1) will begin charging after a further 2 frames. All
  towers will be in their charging state on the 4th frame. At firing time, the
  beams will filter down from the farthest tower to the firing tower. Due to the
  new way in which the actual power of the beam is transferred across the prism
  forwarding network, the minimum charge delay is 1, so you cannot have the
  beams all appear simultaneously. However, at normal game speeds, a charge
  delay of 1 frame is barely noticeable, unless there is a particularly long
  chain in the network.

  Default charge delay is 1. Increase this to have the support beams
  spread across the network more slowly (not recommended, as large values tend
  to lower the quality of the effect).

[BuildingType]PrismForwarding.Intensity=integer - laser thickness
  This allows you to control how thick the laser beam grows as the size of the
  prism network increases. By default, a firing Prism Tower that is supported by
  1 or more other towers would have a LaserThickness of 5 - that's 2
  higher than the default LaserThickness of the firing weapon (3). The
  PrismForwarding.Intensity flag treats negative values as an absolute
  addition to the firing beam, so the default value of -2 leaves the
  behavior exactly the same as the original game.

  Positive values, on the other hand, tell Ares that you want the
  thickness of the beam to be dependent on the number of backward chains in the
  network, and also have the support beam thickness increase in the same way. A
  PrismForwarding.Intensity value of 1 would cause the farthest beam to
  have no thickness increase, the next to have an increase of 1, the next to
  have an increase of 2, and so on. See the section on LaserThickness for
  more information regarding the way lasers are drawn.

[BuildingType]Overpowerable=boolean
  In the original game, a firing Prism Tower always fires its Primary weapon
  (whose damage is multiplied based on the number of supporting towers). The
  Overpowerable flag was ignored. Ares allows firing Prism Towers
  to make use of the overpower logic - you can now have a supported and
  overpowered Prism Tower at the same time! Note that overpowering a support
  tower will not have any effect.

[BuildingType]PrismForwarding.SupportWeapon=weapon
  In the original game, the [PrismSupport]► weapon was never referenced
  directly, and the Secondary weapon of the Prism Tower was only ever
  referenced to get the Range that towers could support over.

  In Ares, the Secondary weapon of the Prism Tower is not
  referenced at all. Instead, we use PrismForwarding.SupportWeapon to
  explicitly reference a weapon object from which to get additional settings for
  the support beam.

  It isn't necessary to specify a support weapon - default values will be used
  if you don't specify one.

[BuildingType]PrismForwarding.EliteSupportWeapon=weapon
  If the tower becomes elite then the support beam will get its properties from
  this weapon. Defaults to PrismForwarding.SupportWeapon.


 Prism; Support Beams

Customizing The Support Beam


The PrismForwarding.SupportWeapon is not a weapon in the traditional
sense and does not actually get fired. Only specific properties of the weapon
are used by the Prism Forwarding system, and these are all described below. Note
that the default values mentioned are **only** used in the event that you have
not specified a support weapon. If you have specified a support weapon, then the
default values are the same as for any other weapon.

It is not recommended to use the existing [PrismSupport]► weapon as a
base. If you want to customize the default values then you should use the
provided example at the end of the following flag list instead.

[PrismForwarding.SupportWeapon]Range=integer - cells
  Specifies the maximum range over which the Prism Tower can support another.
  This does not affect the final firing range. -2 means infinite range.
  If no support weapon is specified then the default support range is the
  tower's Primary weapon range plus 1 cell (the extra cell ensures that
  placing a support tower within the attack radius circle of a firing tower
  guarantees that the support tower is within support range). This is different
  to the original game.
[PrismForwarding.SupportWeapon]MinimumRange=integer - cells
  Specifies the minimum range at which the Prism Tower can support another. This
  Prism Tower will not be able to support towers that are closer than
  MinimumRange. If no support weapon is specified then there is no
  minimum support range by default.
[PrismForwarding.SupportWeapon]ROF=integer - frames
  After a support tower has fired a support beam, it will be unable to fire at a
  target or support another Prism Tower for this many frames. If no support
  weapon is specified then the default duration is
  [General]►PrismSupportDelay.
[PrismForwarding.SupportWeapon]Report=sound
  The sound to play when a Prism Tower fires a support beam. In the original
  game, the support beams did not cause a firing sound to be played. Note that
  lots of Prism Towers firing support beams at once may result in an annoying
  repetition or loud volume, so you may want to limit the number of instances of
  the sound and/or use a quieter or more subtle sound. If no support weapon is
  specified then there is no firing sound for the support beam by default.
[PrismForwarding.SupportWeapon]IsLaser=boolean
  Specifies whether or not a laser beam should be drawn when supporting another
  tower. The other laser controls (LaserDuration, IsHouseColor,
  LaserInnerColor, LaserOuterColor, LaserOuterSpread and
  LaserThickness) are also respected. If no support weapon is specified
  then the traditional support laser will be drawn (IsLaser=yes,
  LaserDuration=[General]►PrismSupportDuration, IsHouseColor=yes,
  LaserThickness=3).
[PrismForwarding.SupportWeapon]IsElectricBolt=boolean
  Specifies whether or not an electric bolt should be drawn when supporting
  another tower. The other electric bolt controls (IsAlternateColor,
  Bolt.Color1, Bolt.Color2 and Bolt.Color3) are also
  respected. If no support weapon is specified then no electric bolt will be
  drawn.
[PrismForwarding.SupportWeapon]IsRadBeam=boolean
  Specifies whether or not a rad beam should be drawn when supporting another
  tower. The other rad beam controls (Beam.Duration,
  Beam.IsHouseColor, Beam.Color and Beam.Amplitude) are
  also respected. If no support weapon is specified then no rad beam will be
  drawn.


No other properties of the support weapon are referenced at present,
however this could be changed in the future.

Example support weapon::

	[NewPrismSupportBeam]
	Range=9 ;or 8 if you prefer the original
	ROF=45
	IsLaser=yes
	IsHouseColor=yes
	LaserDuration=15
	LaserThickness=3


Support Beam FLH


The firing origin of the support beam can be set by using the FLH controls on
the building's art entry - AlternateFLH0 specifies the rookie support
beam origin, AlternateFLH1 specifies the elite support beam origin. If
either of these is set to 0,0,0 (the default FLH value) then they will
fall back to using PrimaryFireFLH or ElitePrimaryFireFLH, as
appropriate.



Prism Tower Limitations


Prism Towers should not be allowed to undeploy - undeploying a Prism Tower
during a charge sequence can cause an Internal Error.


Special Note Regarding Prism Forwarding

A common error that was reported during testing was a tendency for Prism Towers
to not auto-target and engage enemy units. The solution for this was to be sure
that warhead and/or damage was defined. If this happens to you, be sure to check
that your PF modification defines warhead values or damage values.
