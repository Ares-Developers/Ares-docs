 Spies; Multiple effects on a single building

Spy Behavior


Yuri's Revenge only permits a Spy to achieve one effect on infiltrating,
which is determined by a hard-coded order of precedence. Spy infiltration logic
has been rewritten in Ares to be more flexible, including some new
effects that a Spy can achieve.

All of the following flags default to no or 0.

 0.1

[BuildingType]SpyEffect.Custom=boolean
  Whether or not to use the Ares spy infiltration logic instead of the
  original Yuri's Revenge logic.

 Must be set to yes for any of the following effects to
  work...



 Spies; Show what the enemy can see

Radar


[BuildingType]SpyEffect.ResetRadar=boolean
  Whether or not spying this enemy building will cause the normal radar sabotage
  behavior (i.e. re-shrouding the enemy's map down to just the terrain that they
  can presently see).
[BuildingType]SpyEffect.RevealRadar=boolean
  **NEW EFFECT** Whether or not spying this enemy radar will reveal all further
  unit movements to the infiltrating player. Enemy units will then scout the map
  like own units until the infiltrated building is destroyed, sold, or captured.
  The building must also have Radar=yes set.
[BuildingType]SpyEffect.KeepRadar=boolean
  **NEW EFFECT** If enabled, a player infiltrating this building will still have
  access to the owning player's radar even if the building is destroyed, sold,
  or captured. Otherwise the spy effect is removed. Requires
  SpyEffect.RevealRadar=yes and a Radar=yes building.



 Spies; Create power outage

Power


[BuildingType]SpyEffect.PowerOutageDuration=integer - frames
  The number of frames for which the enemy's power will be sabotaged (i.e.
  temporarily reduced to zero).



 Spies; Steal fixed amount or percentage of money

Money


[BuildingType]SpyEffect.StolenMoneyAmount=integer - credits
  **NEW EFFECT** The amount of credits that will be stolen from the enemy upon
  spying this enemy building.
  
  The amount of money ultimately stolen from the enemy is always capped by the
  amount of money they presently have (i.e. if
  SpyEffect.StolenMoneyAmount=500 but the enemy only has 200 credits then
  you will only gain 200 credits from spying the building).
[BuildingType]SpyEffect.StolenMoneyPercentage=float - percentage
  The percentage of the enemy's current credits that will be stolen from the
  enemy upon spying this enemy building. Only has an effect if
  SpyEffect.StolenMoneyAmount=0.




  Spies; Reset all super weapons a building provides
  Spies; Grant one-time or permanent super weapon

Super Weapons


[BuildingType]SpyEffect.ResetSuperweapons=boolean
  Whether or not spying this enemy building will cause all super weapons
  attached to it (SuperWeapon, SuperWeapon2, SuperWeapons
  and all super weapons on attached upgrades) to have their countdown timers
  restarted.


The following tags can be used to grant super weapons like the Sonar Pulse in
Red Alert when a spy infiltrates a Sub Pen.

[BuildingType]SpyEffect.SuperWeapon=SuperWeaponType
  **NEW EFFECT** Grants this super weapon when infiltrating an enemy building of
  this type.

   Not all super weapon types might be supported.

[BuildingType]SpyEffect.SuperWeaponPermanent=boolean
  Whether the granted super weapon will become available permanently. If
  yes, it will become available uncharged, and it won't be lost once
  fired. Otherwise, the super weapon will become available pre-charged but
  disappear again after being fired once. Defaults to no.

 0.B





 Spies; Grant multiple stolen techs

Stolen Technology


[BuildingType]SpyEffect.StolenTechIndex= list of integers
  The stealable technology types that is stolen upon spying this enemy building.
  Only values from 0 to 31 (inclusive) are supported. Use -1 to
  disable the effect. Defaults to -1.

   Note that despite its singular name this tag takes a list of
    integers and it is thus possible to steal several technology types when
    infiltrating a single building.

[TechnoType]Prerequisite.StolenTechs=list of integers
  The list of stealable technology types that must be stolen before this object
  can be built. Only values from 0 to 31 (inclusive) are supported. Use
  -1 to disable this requirement. Defaults to -1.

In Yuri's Revenge, there were only three types of stealable technology
available and these were hard-coded to the first three buildings in the
[AI]►BuildTech list (game defaults given in parens):

+ Spying the first (GATECH) satisfies RequiresStolenAlliedTech=yes
+ Spying the second (NATECH) satisfies RequiresStolenSovietTech=yes
+ Spying the third (YATECH) satisfies RequiresStolenThirdTech=yes

In Ares, spying a building with SpyEffect.StolenTechIndex=2 (for
example) satisfies the stolen tech requirements for units that require stolen
tech 2.

 If you set SpyEffect.Custom=yes on buildings in the
  BuildTech list (like GATECH, NATECH or YATECH),
  then those buildings will no longer satisfy the old RequiresStolen*Tech
  flags.

 0.B



 Spies; Build vehicles or train infantry as veteran
 Spies; Veteran buildings or aircraft or navy

Veterancy


Ares adds five independent fine grained controls to gain veterancy by
spying, thus it is possible to grant one or more types veterancy at the same
time where the original game only supported either InfantryType\ s or
VehicleType\ s depending on the Factory= setting.

[BuildingType]SpyEffect.InfantryVeterancy=boolean
  Whether spying this building will make all future infantry with
  Trainable=yes you build from your own factories start veteran. Defaults
  to no.

[BuildingType]SpyEffect.VehicleVeterancy=boolean
  Whether spying this building will make all future Naval=no vehicles
  with Trainable=yes you build from your own factories start veteran.
  Defaults to no.

[BuildingType]SpyEffect.NavalVeterancy=boolean
  **NEW EFFECT** Whether spying this building will make all future
  Naval=yes vehicles with Trainable=yes you build from your own
  factories start veteran. Defaults to no.

[BuildingType]SpyEffect.AircraftVeterancy=boolean
  **NEW EFFECT** Whether spying this building will make all future aircraft with
  Trainable=yes you build from your own factories start veteran.
  Defaults to no.

[BuildingType]SpyEffect.BuildingVeterancy=boolean
  **NEW EFFECT** Whether spying this building will make all future buildings
  with Trainable=yes you build from your own Construction Yards start
  veteran. Defaults to no.

 single: Spies; Reveal production, money, or power

Intelligence


[BuildingType]SpyEffect.RevealProduction=boolean
  **NEW EFFECT** Whether or not spying this enemy building will allow you to see
  what the enemy is presently building from that factory, or the power output,
  or the owning player's money. Once the building has been spied, select the
  building and the information of the unit that is being produced will be
  displayed over the building.

  * Fake=yes buildings will show the text TXT_FAKE and reveal
    their true name in tooltips (see EnemyUIName)
  * Power greater than 0 buildings will reveal the power level
    (formatted using TXT_POWER_DRAIN2)
  * Storage greater than 0 buildings will see the player's
    credits (formatted using TXT_MONEY_FORMAT_1)
  * Factory buildings will reveal the cameo of the current production

   Observers have been enabled to always have access to this
    information.

 single: Spies; Reset all reverse engineered build options

Reverse Engineering


Reset a player's build options gained by Reverse Engineering.

[BuildingType]SpyEffect.UndoReverseEngineer=boolean
  **NEW EFFECT** Whether spying this building will remove all technology the
  infiltrated player has reverse-engineered so far. Defaults to no.

 0.2



 single: Spies; Demolish infiltrated building

Sabotage


[BuildingType]SpyEffect.SabotageDelay=integer - frames
  The number of frames after which the building will be demolished as if C4 had
  been planted. If negative, [CombatDamage]►C4Delay is used. Use
  0 to disable. Defaults to 0.
