 Buildings; Buildings that can be driven upon

Passable Structures


There are two ways to create buildings that units can move over, but both have
side effects: LaserFence=yes makes the building immune to damage and
enforces the electro infantry death in case it has a weapon, while
Firestorm.Wall=yes makes the building part of the Firestorm logic.

In Firestorm, IsLimpetMine serves a similar purpose, though it
has other effects like not taking attack orders and being destroyed by EMP.

To create a proper land mine that occupies a cell transparently to moving units
while not having any other effect, Ares adds a new tag to overcome these
considerations.

[BuildingType]IsPassable=boolean
  Whether the cells the building occupies can still be entered or stood on by
  vehicles and infantry. Defaults to no.
