 Buildings; Trivial Structure Damage in low power situations

Trivial Structure Damage


When a house is suffering low power, buildings can be made to degrade just like
in the earlier games like Tiberian Dawn and Red Alert. The
buildings lose health while they are unpowered, defined by an amount and an
interval, down to a minimum health. The damage is always dealt by
[General]►C4Warhead.

In the earlier games, only buildings consuming power degraded one hitpoint per
interval until reaching yellow health.

[General]Degrade.Enabled=boolean
  Whether structures are damaged in intervals defined by DamageDelay when
  a player has low power. Defaults to no.

[General]Degrade.Percentage=double - percentage
  The health above which this building will continue to degrade during low power
  situations. Buildings with health equal to or below this will not degrade
  further. Defaults to [AudioVisual]►ConditionYellow.

[General]Degrade.AmountNormal=integer - hitpoints
  The damage caused to buildings with Power equal to or greater than
  0 in low power situations. Defaults to 0.

[General]Degrade.AmountConsumer=integer - hitpoints
  The damage caused to buildings with Power less than 0 in low
  power situations. Defaults to 1.

These global options can be customized per BuildingType.

[BuildingType]Degrade.Percentage=double - percentage
  The percentage of health this building will degrade to in low power
  situations. A value of 1.0 will not degrade this building, a value of
  0.0 will make it degrade till complete destruction. Defaults to
  [General]►Degrade.Percentage.

[BuildingType]Degrade.Amount=integer - hitpoints
  The amount of damage this building will receive each interval of
  DamageDelay in low power situations. A value of 0 will not
  degrade this building. Defaults to [General]►Degrade.AmountNormal if
  Power is greater than or equal to 0, otherwise to
  [General]►Degrade.AmountConsumer.

Trivial Structure Damage can be enabled or disabled for each house individually.
By default, MultiplayPassive=yes houses are not affected.

[Country]Degrades=boolean
  Whether buildings owned by this country degrade in low power situations.
  Defaults to no for MultiplayPassive=yes, to yes
  otherwise.

[House]Degrades=boolean
  Whether buildings owned by this country degrade in low power situations. Only
  supported in single player missions. Defaults to [Country]►Degrades.
