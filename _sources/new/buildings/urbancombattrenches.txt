 Buildings; Trenches

Urban Combat - Trenches


This section covers several new features that were designed together in order to
allow mod authors to add occupiable trenches to the game. These features do not
all have to be used together to implement trenches though - each feature has
been designed to be customizable and can be used separately.

  This means that these individual features do not distinguish between
  buildings that are a trench and buildings that are not. It is important that
  you understand how each new flag works - both on its own and in conjunction
  with other trench-related flags.



  Buildings; Weapons passing through urban combat buildings
  Weapons; Hit occupants inside buildings
  Projectiles; Subject to trenches

Pass Through


Urban Combat buildings can now specify what percentage of attacks against them
will 'pass through' to the occupants inside -- damaging them rather than the
building itself.

[BuildingType]UC.PassThrough=float - chance
  The percentage of shots that will pass through to the occupants (and therefore
  not damage this building). Defaults to 0% (i.e. all shots damage the
  building / no shots damage the occupants). When there are no occupants inside
  then UC.PassThrough will be ignored (i.e. all shots damage the
  building).
[BuildingType]UC.FatalRate=float - chance
  In the event that a shot has passed through, the percentage of those shots
  that will instantly kill one occupant, disregarding the weapon entirely.
  Defaults to 0%.
[BuildingType]UC.DamageMultiplier=float - multiplier
  If a shot has passed through but isn't necessarily fatal then one occupant
  will be damaged. The damage dealt by the weapon will be multiplied by
  UC.DamageMultiplier. Defaults to 100% (i.e. no change to the
  damage dealt by the weapon).
[Projectile]SubjectToTrenches=boolean
  Whether or not this projectile will override the normal
  UC.PassThrough chance on targeted buildings. If the projectile has
  SubjectToTrenches=no set, and the target building has
  UC.PassThrough set greater than zero, then the building will be treated
  as if it had UC.PassThrough=100%, when hit by this projectile. If
  SubjectToTrenches=yes is set (default), then the normal
  UC.PassThrough chance will be used when the building is hit by this
  projectile.

SubjectToTrenches was very much intended for trenches - a Grenadier, for
example, would easily be able to drop their grenade into an open trench and
would therefore definitely harm the occupants.

 The name SubjectToTrenches is misleading if you are not
  thinking about trenches. This has an effect on all occupiable buildings with
  UC.PassThrough > 0%.

  Buildings; Raid garrisonable but unoccupied enemy buildings
  Bunkers; Raid unoccupied enemy buildings

Squatters' Rights


You can now specify that Battle Bunkers, for example, can be captured by enemy
infantry just by having them walk in and garrison the building as if it were
their own.

[BuildingType]Bunker.Raidable=boolean
  Whether or not this building can be garrisoned by an enemy player's infantry,
  provided the building is not already occupied.


If Bunker.Raidable=yes is set and the building is empty then the building
can be garrisoned by any player's infantry. When another player garrisons the
building, ownership is transferred to that player. At this point the building
can only be further garrisoned by the player whose troops are inside. If the
occupants leave the building then ownership of the building is transferred back
to its original owner. Whilst a building is held by a player that is not the
"true" owner, that building cannot be sold.

Advanced Rubble


If you really hit a trench hard enough to destroy it you're only doing one of
two things; either you're turning a small hole into a larger hole, or you're
making it collapse. Either way, you don't really remove the trench from the
battlefield - just render it unusable. It will be easier to re-dig a trench
there than on untouched soil, and, on the other hand, you can't just build
there like nothing ever happened.

Note that Engineers will not be 'used up' by this repair process - they keep
existing outside of the trench. This is very much intended for trenches: an
Engineer would not be repairing/rebuilding an entire building, just re-digging a
trench so his work would not be too exhausting.

 \ Ares enforces the foundations of Rubble.Destroyed=
  and Rubble.Intact= to match those of the original BuildingType.
  Custom foundations never match built-in foundations. A fatal error will be
  raised if you do not comply with this requirement and the game will exit.

Advanced Rubble is implemented in a similar way to other upgrade systems in
Ares. The first set is for converting a building to rubble:

[BuildingType]Rubble.Destroyed=BuildingType
  The new BuildingType that this BuildingType will transform
  into upon destruction. By default the building will be created with maximum
  Strength. Engineers will always get a repair cursor over the building.
  Buildings that are created via `Rubble.Destroyed` will have the following
  properties forced upon them:

  ::

    Capturable=no
    TogglePower=no
    Unsellable=yes
    CanBeOccupied=no

   Do not create loops using Rubble.Destroyed. This can
    freeze the game. A building cannot be its own rubble, neither directly or
    indirectly over one or more other BuildingTypes.

[BuildingType]Rubble.Destroyed.Remove=boolean
  Whether the building should just disappear instead of being converted to
  rubble. Overrides Rubble.Destroyed. Defaults to no.

[BuildingType]Rubble.Destroyed.Owner=enumeration default|civilian|special|neutral
  The country the destroyed building will belong to. default is the
  current owner, civilian is the first country from the side called
  Civilian, special and neutral are the countries
  named Special and Neutral respectively. Defaults to
  default.

[BuildingType]Rubble.Destroyed.Strength=integer
  The health the rubble building is created with. Positive values up to
  Strength are used directly. Negative values down to -99 are a
  percentage of full health, -1 meaning 1% of health. All other values
  mean full health. Defaults to Strength.

[BuildingType]Rubble.Destroyed.Anim=AnimationType
  An animation played when a building converted to rubble or removed. Defaults
  to none.

There is a second set of tags to recover a building from rubble, which mirrors
the first set:

[BuildingType]Rubble.Intact=BuildingType
  The new BuildingType that this BuildingType will transform
  into when it is repaired. The repaired building will be created with 1%
  Strength, unless set otherwise.

[BuildingType]Rubble.Intact.Remove=boolean
  Whether the building should just disappear instead of being recovered when an
  Engineer enters. Overrides Rubble.Intact. Defaults to no.

[BuildingType]Rubble.Intact.Owner=enumeration default|civilian|special|neutral
  The country the recovered building will belong to. default is the
  current owner, civilian is the first country from the side called
  Civilian, special and neutral are the countries
  named Special and Neutral respectively. Defaults to
  default.

[BuildingType]Rubble.Intact.Strength=integer
  The health the recovered building is created with. Positive values up to
  Strength are used directly. Negative values down to -99 are a
  percentage of full health, -1 meaning 1% of health. All other values
  mean full health. Defaults to -1, 1% of Strength.

[BuildingType]Rubble.Intact.Anim=AnimationType
  An animation played when a building is recovered or removed. Defaults to
  none.

  Buildings; Infantry can move from one urban combat building to an adjacent one

  Occupiers; Move infantry from one urban combat building to an adjacent one

Traversing Trenches


A major concept of trenches is the ability for infantry to move from one segment
of a trench to the next, on the basis that adjacent segments are connected and,
in essence, the same trench.

[BuildingType]IsTrench=string - trench type ID
  Specifies a unique name for this particular trench so that the game knows that
  it is a trench for traversal purposes, and allows occupants to transfer
  between segments of the same trench type.


For example, let's say you have IsTrench=AlliedModern. You have 2
segments of this trench adjacent to one another and one of these segments is
garrisoned. If you select the garrisoned segment and then position the mouse
cursor over the adjacent segment, you will get an 'enter' cursor over the
adjacent segment. Clicking now with the enter cursor showing will transfer the
occupants from the garrisoned segment into the adjacent segment.

 There is no special image-handling with IsTrench logic (yet);
  you will not get nice rows of trenches with proper joins/closed off ends like
  you do with, say, walls or Laser Fences.

Specifying the occupants of a building


You can now specify which infantries are allowed to enter into a building.

[BuildingType]CanBeOccupiedBy=list of InfantryTypes
  Lists the units which are allowed to enter to this building. Requires
  Occupier=yes on the infantry.
