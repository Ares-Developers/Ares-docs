The Assaulter logic can be customized with the following tag, to make
certain buildings unassaultable, or to create infantry that can even assault
specially protected buildings.

  Defines the levels compared when an Assaulter=yes infantry is to
  assault building. Infantry can only assault buildings with levels less than
  or equal to their own level. Defaults to 0.
