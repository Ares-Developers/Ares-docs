Assaulter


The Assaulter logic can be customized with the following tag, to make
certain buildings unassaultable, or to create infantry that can even assault
specially protected buildings.

[TechnoType]Assaulter.Level=integer
  Defines the levels compared when an Assaulter=yes infantry is to
  assault building. Infantry can only assault buildings with levels less than
  or equal to their own level. Defaults to 0.

 Buildings with Assaulter.Level < 0 are not
  assaultable.
