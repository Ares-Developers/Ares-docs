Repair and Insufficient Funds


This global tag can be used to change how the repair mode works. By default, all
repairing is stopped once a player no longer has enough credits to afford it.
After gaining some credits, the buildings have to be ordered to repair again.
With this tag, repairing will pause, but not stop.

[General]RepairStopOnInsufficientFunds=boolean
  Whether repairing will automatically be stopped when the owning player has
  insufficient funds. If no, repairing mode will not be turned off. The
  wrench will still be visible, even though the building is no longer actively
  repaired. Repairing will resume when the player gains more funds. This only
  affects human players. Defaults to yes.
