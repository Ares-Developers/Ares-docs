Academies


Academies are buildings that grant their owners the right to train specified
units and structures with a certain promotion level. If a player owns more than
one academy buildings, the highest bonus is awarded. The effect does not stack.

Only Trainable=yes units or structures can get a veterancy bonus. If an
object has been promoted to a higher level by other means already (like from
VeteranInfantry, or by infiltrating an enemy War Factory), the veterancy
level is not reduced.

A value of 1.0 means veteran, a value of 2.0 means elite. You
can use decimal values to grant only partial levels, so the next promotion will
come earlier.

but the specified types. By default, academies promote all types.
