 Buildings; BuildupTime and separate SellTime

Buildup and Sell Time


The global setting [General]►BuildupTime has been deglobalized and split
into two separate tags for construction and selling on BuildingTypes.

Also, Ares now supports make animations having more frames than the
buildup time without glitching. In case the buildup time is too short and it
would require skipping frames, the buildup time is automatically increased so
this does not happen anymore.

[BuildingType]BuildupTime=double - minutes
  The time the buildup animation plays regardless of the number of frames.
  Defaults to [General]►BuildupTime.

   Note that certain building functions still become available
    immediately after being placed, not only after being fully constructed.

[BuildingType]SellTime=double - minutes
  Analogous to BuildTime when a building is sold. Defaults to
  BuildupTime.
