 Buildings; Repair wrench not visible for enemies

Enemy Wrench


There's a tag called [General]â–ºEnemyHealth to hide a unit's health bar
from enemy players. Ares adds a new tag that does the same for the
wrench animation appearing when a player click repairs a structure.

[General]EnemyWrench=boolean
  Whether players not allied with the owning player can see the repair wrench
  animation playing if the building is click repaired. Observers can always see
  the wrench animation. Defaults to yes.

   The wrench animation will not show if a building is being attacked
    by a temporal weapon or an enemy building is cloaked.
