Secret Labs


The original Secret Lab system had three separate global flags to control the
boons and did not allow for AircraftTypes to be granted. Secret Lab
logic also had some flaws which have been resolved (see
...).

In Ares, the boon is only picked after the building is first captured by
a MultiplayPassive=no country, or assigned to it if pre-placed on the
map. The boon ultimately offered is picked at random, but only boons that are
not presently buildable by the owner of the Secret Lab are eligible to be
selected.

This logic has been extended with the following 'per building' flags.
SecretLab=yes must be set on the building before it will be treated as a
Secret Lab and so allow these flags to be considered.

[Building]SecretLab.PossibleBoons=list of TechnoTypes
  Specifies all the buildings, vehicles, infantry and aircraft that this
  particular building could potentially award as a secret lab boon. Defaults to
  all items from [General]►SecretInfantry, [General]►SecretUnits
  and [General]►SecretBuildings.
[Building]SecretLab.GenerateOnCapture=boolean
  Whether the Secret Lab shall re-pick the boon to be offered every time the
  building is captured by or assigned to a MultiplayPassive=no country.
  Otherwise, the boon is picked only once, the first time it is assigned to such
  country. Defaults to no.

Each possible boon can specify the following flags. Both are only checked at the
time a boon is picked, so if SecretLab.GenerateOnCapture=no, then the
boon might still be obtained by a forbidden country, or denied a required
country if the Secret Lab is captured later on.

 This means that such Secret Labs may appear to disobey
  SecretLab.RequiredHouses and SecretLab.ForbiddenHouses when
  captured. This is not a bug.

[Boon]SecretLab.RequiredHouses=list of countries
  Specifies which countries are allowed to get this unit as a Secret Lab boon.
  Defaults to all houses.
[Boon]SecretLab.ForbiddenHouses=list of countries
  Specifies which countries are not allowed to get this unit as a Secret Lab
  boon. Defaults to none.
