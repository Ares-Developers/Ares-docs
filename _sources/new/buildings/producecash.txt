Oil Derricks (ProduceCash)


General Changes


Building upgrades now support ProduceCashDelay, ProduceCashAmount
and ProduceCashStartup like normal buildings. Each upgrade manages its
own timer, so they will grant the amount independently of the main building or
other upgrades.

ProduceCashStartup has been expanded to support negative values. The
amount is withdrawn from the capturing player's account. If less than the
specified amount is available, then the building can still be captured or
placed. Also, ProduceCashStartup is no longer granted if a building is
captured by a MultiplayPassive=yes house.

Unlike in the original game, ProduceCashStartup does not have to be
non-null for ProduceCashDelay and ProduceCashAmount to work.

 Tech Structures; Display the produced cash amount

Display Cash Produced


Buildings producing cash can display the amount they generated as a text
appearing over the building. The text will appear above the building and then
move up slightly.

[BuildingType]ProduceCashDisplay=boolean
  Whether the building will show the credits it produced. Not respected on
  upgrades. The setting from the main building type will be used instead.
  Defaults to no.

[AudioVisual]DisplayCreditsDelay=double - minutes
  The interval between two texts appearing to display how many credits a
  building produced. Until then, the amounts are collected to be displayed after
  the interval passed. Defaults to 0.02.

At the moment the colors are hardcoded to green for positive amounts and red for
negative amounts. the format is hardcoded to the amount with a plus or minus
sign prefixed.

 This feature might be expanded or changed in the future. Do not
  take the appearance of these texts for granted. Colors, positions, and
  movement speed might change.
