 Buildings; Include in or exclude them from drag-selection

Mass-Selection


In Tiberian Sun units like the Tick Tank and the Artillery could deploy
into 1x1 buildings. These buildings were considered vehicles when dragging a
selection rectangle, so many of them could be undeployed quickly.

This feature is still available in Yuri's Revenge and cannot be turned
off for buildings that might be undeployable but should not be considered
vehicles.

In Ares this feature can be disabled for 1x1 structures or enabled for
buildings with larger foundations that should be considered vehicles:

[BuildingType]MassSelectable=boolean
  Whether buildings of this type are considered units when mass-selecting. If
  no, buildings will not be included in the selection, even if they
  undeploy into a unit and are actually to be considered vehicles. Defaults to
  yes for 1x1 buildings with UndeploysInto= set.
