 Buildings; Rudimentary lightning rods

Lightning Rods


Lightning rods attract Lightning Storms and optionally modify their damage.

[BuildingType]LightningRod=boolean
  Specifies whether this building attracts lightning. If this building is the
  closest object to a cloud created randomly, the cloud will be created just
  above the building. Defaults to no.
[BuildingType]LightningRod.Modifier=float - modifier
  Buildings with LightningRod=yes set being hit by lightning get the
  damage multiplied by this value. Values less than 1.0 reduce damage, larger
  values increase the damage. Defaults to 1.0.

 This logic is likely to be expanded in future versions.

 0.2
