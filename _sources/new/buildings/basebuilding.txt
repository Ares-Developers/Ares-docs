 Bases; Disable extending base space for the AI

Extending Base Space of the AI


The AI's base space is extended by any building that is not considered a
vehicle, and unrestricted by BaseNormal, which only applies to human
players. Ares adds an option to disable extending base space.

[BuildingType]AIBaseNormal=boolean
  Whether this building will extend the base space of the AI player. Defaults to
  no if both UndeploysInto= is set and
  ResourceGatherer=yes, otherwise defaults to whether the building is
  considered a vehicle.

 Bases; Prefer placing buildings in the AI's inner base

Prefer to build in the AI's Inner Base


Preferrably placing Stealth Generators in the center of the base rather than on
the perimeter was a side effect of CloakGenerator=yes in
Tiberian Sun. This feature has been recreated and made optional.

[BuildingType]AIInnerBase=boolean
  Whether the AI prefers to place this building closer to the center of its
  base. Use this for buildings that are to be protected or that provide a ranged
  effect that works best if it covers large portions of the base. Defaults to
  yes if CloakGenerator=yes, to no otherwise.

   The larger the building foundation, the more unlikely it will be for
    the AI to find a place to build it near the base center in late game, in
    which case the game will fall back to the original logic and find a place in
    the perimeter.
