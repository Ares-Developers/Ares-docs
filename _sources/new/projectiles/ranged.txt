 Projectiles; Running out of fuel and detonating

Ranged


This feature has been restored from Tiberian Sun. It is again possible
to create a projectile that can run out of fuel and detonate in mid-air, if it
has not reached its destination by then.

The default range is about 390 cells. See ProjectileRange on how to customize it.

[Projectile]Ranged=boolean
