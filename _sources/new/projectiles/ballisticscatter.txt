 Projectiles; BallisticScatter

BallisticScatter


The global [CombatDamage]►BallisticScatter is used for defining a range
depending on the projectile's properties, and then randomly picking a value from
this range as the final scatter distance for each projectile fired. Ares
makes this global customizable as two separate tags that can be used to specify
the minimum and maximum distances for each Projectile directly.

Both tags require Inaccurate=yes and Arcing=yes.

[Projectile]BallisticScatter.Min=float - cell range
  The minimum range in cells a projectile can scatter. Defaults to
  [CombatDamage]►BallisticScatter / 2 if FlakScatter=no or
  Inviso=yes, to 0 otherwise.

[Projectile]BallisticScatter.Max=float - cell range
  The maximum range in cells a projectile can scatter. Defaults to
  [CombatDamage]►BallisticScatter.

 \ Inaccurate=yes prevents projectiles to "snap" to their target
  on impact, and thus they will not deal damage to them because this does not
  count as a direct hit even if ballistic scatter is set to a low value. Using
  CellSpread fixes this.

 There is one more place [CombatDamage]►BallisticScatter is used
  and that is not customizable yet. It scatters an extra amount from 0
  to 2 * [CombatDamage]►BallisticScatter for projectiles with
  both FlakScatter=yes and Inviso=yes set.
