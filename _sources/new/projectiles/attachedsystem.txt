 Projectiles; ParticleSystems as trailers

AttachedSystem Trailers


In addition to using animation trailers, Ares allows to attach particle
systems to projectiles to emit smoke particles on their way to the target. This
works like the same tag on VoxelAnimTypes.

[Projectile]AttachedSystem=ParticleSystemType
  The type of the particle system to attach to this projectile. Only particle
  systems  with BehavesLike=smoke are supported.
