Anti-Vehicle (AV)


In Firestorm, the Limpet Mine could attach to VehicleTypes only:
It would ignore infantry and aircraft. This was achieved by not allowing players
to command the mine to attack objects directly, and by using the newly
introduced AV, which auto-acquired only vehicles.

 This logic uses this definition of *vehicles*: VehicleTypes on
  the ground that are Naval=no and ConsideredAircraft=no. This
  includes hovering units.

Opposed to Tiberian Sun, this does not override AG and AA,
for acquiring a new target and it can be defined independently of the two. This
means both being able to automatically acquire ground units but not vehicles, as
well as not acquiring other ground units while still being able to acquire
vehicles.

With AV=no, Ares also prohibits targeting vehicles and players
will not get an attack cursor on them. Vehicles in the air fall into the
responsibility of AA, and AV does not interfere with targeting.

[Projectile]AV=boolean
  Whether this projectile can be fired at VehicleTypes on the ground
  that are not ConsideredAircraft=yes. Defaults to AG for
  passive-acquiring targets; for firing it is enabled if LandTargeting is
  set to a value not equal to 1.
