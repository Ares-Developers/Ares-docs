Animations and Rotates=yes


Projectiles with Rotates=yes used their image's 32 frames to represent
moving in different directions, one frame per facing. This means these
projectiles did not support being animated. Ares adds support for this.

[Projectile]AnimLength=integer - frames
  The number of frames the animation for each facing has. Playback speed is one
  frame every AnimRate frames. The animation is not guaranteed to play
  from the first frame on. Defaults to 1.

   \ AnimRate cannot be 0, or a division by zero will
    crash the game once a projectile of this type is fired.
