Killing Drivers


Requested as a "Jarmen Kell" functionality
, this feature allows
specific warheads to kill the driver of a vehicle instead of damaging
it, and allows others to take over the now-neutral vehicle.

[Warhead]KillDriver=boolean
  Specifies whether this warhead kills the driver of the vehicle, instead of
  damaging the vehicle itself. The first passenger matching the vehicle's
  Operator is considered the driver. All other passengers will be
  ejected. Defaults to no.
[Warhead]KillDriver.KillBelowPercent=float
  Specifies the percentage of health a unit can not exceed to have its driver
  killed by a KillDriver=yes warhead. A unit above this health level
  is only damaged and the driver is not killed. Defaults to 100%.
[TechnoType]ProtectedDriver=boolean
  Whether the driver of this vehicle cannot be killed, i.e. whether this vehicle
  is immune to KillDriver. Organic=yes and Natural=yes
  units are always immune to KillDriver. Defaults to no.
[TechnoType]CanDrive=boolean
  Whether this InfantryType can act as the driver of vehicles whose
  driver has been killed, effectively reclaiming the vehicle. If the vehicle
  requires an Operator the infantry driver turns the unit and enters as
  passenger that can be ejected later, otherwise the driver is swallowed,
  becoming the permanent driver of the vehicle. Defaults to no.

 Vehicle Thieves cannot drive neutralized vehicles by default, but
  VehicleThief=yes can be combined with CanDrive=yes without
  problems.
