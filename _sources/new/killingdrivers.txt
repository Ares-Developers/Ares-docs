Killing Drivers


Requested as a "Jarmen Kell" functionality, this feature allows specific
warheads to kill the driver of a vehicle instead of damaging it, and allows
others to take over the now-neutral vehicle.

Warhead Settings


This logic supports CellSpread and respects all immunities as any other
conventional warhead like ImmuneToPoison as well as their veteran
abilities, AffectsAllies, and AffectsEnemies.

Whether this effect is applied when no conventional damage is dealt can be
customized. See ....

[Warhead]KillDriver=boolean
  Specifies whether this warhead kills the driver of the vehicle, instead of
  damaging the vehicle itself. The first passenger matching the vehicle's
  Operator is considered the driver. All other passengers will be
  ejected. Defaults to no.
[Warhead]KillDriver.Owner=enumeration - civilian,special,neutral
  Specifies the house the units are assigned to. Defaults to special.
[Warhead]KillDriver.KillBelowPercent=float
  Specifies the percentage of health a unit cannot exceed to have its driver
  killed by a KillDriver=yes warhead. A unit above this health level
  is only damaged and the driver is not killed. Defaults to 100%.
[Warhead]KillDriver.Chance=float - percentage
  Specifies the chance that a unit hit by a KillDriver=yes warhead will
  have its driver killed. Defaults to 100%.
[Warhead]KillDriver.RemoveVeterancy=boolean
  Whether a unit will revert to rookie rank when the driver is killed and the
  unit changes owner. Not applied if the owner does not change. Defaults to
  no.


.. _killingdrivers-immunity:


  Kill Driver; Protect drivers of vehicles
  TechnoTypes; Driver can't be killed

Protected Drivers


The following settings can make a unit immune to the Kill Driver logic:

[TechnoType]ProtectedDriver=boolean
  Whether the driver of this vehicle cannot be killed, i.e. whether this vehicle
  is immune to KillDriver. Organic=yes and Natural=yes
  units are always immune to KillDriver. Defaults to no.
[TechnoType]ProtectedDriver.MinHealth=double - percentage
  The minimum health below which the driver of this unit can be killed. If the
  unit's health is above this, the driver cannot be killed. If
  KillDriver.KillBelowPercent is also defined on the warhead, the
  minimum of the two values is used, that is, this tag can make a unit more
  resistant against driver killing weapons. Defaults to 0.0 if
  ProtectedDriver=yes, to 1.0 otherwise.

Driver protection can also be granted by specifying PROTECTED_DRIVER
under VeteranAbilities or EliteAbilities. If specified, the unit's
driver becomes protected unconditionally against KillDriver (which means
that ProtectedDriver.MinHealth is no longer checked), but not against
damage or other special warhead effects.



  Kill Driver; Reclaim vehicles
  Infantry; Capture units that had their drivers killed

Reclaim Vehicles


Drivers are infantry units that can capture neutral vehicles, like ones that had
their driver killed.

[TechnoType]CanDrive=boolean
  Whether this InfantryType can act as the driver of vehicles whose
  driver has been killed, effectively reclaiming the vehicle. If the vehicle
  requires an Operator the infantry driver turns the unit and enters as
  passenger that can be ejected later, otherwise the driver is swallowed,
  becoming the permanent driver of the vehicle. Defaults to no.

[TechnoType]CanBeDriven=boolean
  Whether this unit can be reclaimed by a driver. If no, this unit
  cannot be captured by a driver after the original driver has been killed.
  If yes, ownership and other still might still prevent the unit from
  being captured. Defaults to yes.

[Country]CanBeDriven=boolean
  Whether units owned by this country can be captured by CanDrive=yes
  infantry. This can be used to place units owned by neutral countries on the
  map without them being capturable. Defaults to MultiplayPassive.

 Vehicle Thieves cannot drive neutralized vehicles by default, but
  VehicleThief=yes can be combined with CanDrive=yes without
  problems.

See ... for more options that relate to CanDrive.
