Chronoshift


These options specify what the Chronosphere should do with an object.

[TechnoType]Chronoshift.Allow=boolean
  Specifies whether this unit is allowed to be affected by the Chronosphere
  super weapon. Otherwise it will be ignored. Defaults to yes.

[BuildingType]Chronoshift.IsVehicle=boolean
  Specifies whether this building is actually a deployed vehicle and should be
  chronoshifted by the Chronosphere super weapon if it affects units and
  Chronosphere.ReconsiderBuildings=yes is set. On the other hand this
  building will not be considered a building anymore and thus will be ignored by
  a Chronosphere that doesn't affect units. Defaults to no.

Units can be made immune to chronoshift-crushing:

[TechnoType]Chronoshift.Crushable=boolean
  If set to no, this unit can no longer be crushed by chronoshifting
  units onto it. Instead, the chronoshifting unit will be destroyed. Does not
  apply to BuildingType\ s. Defaults to yes.

Globally disallow chronoshifting infantry to crush non-infantry:

[General]ChronoInfantryCrush=boolean
  If set to no, infantry will die when being chronoshifted onto tanks
  instead of destroying the tanks. Defaults to yes.
