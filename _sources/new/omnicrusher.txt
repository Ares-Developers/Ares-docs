OmniCrusher Enhancements


OmniCrusher=yes units are allowed to overrun enemies, and units are eager
to try that when ordered to attack a victim, or when retaliating against an
enemy unit firing at it. This mechanism is sometimes useful, but sometimes it is
not. Like when a Battle Fortress deliberately closes in on a group of enemy
tanks, and is then lured into an ambush and overpowered itself.

Ares allows deactivating the aggressive behavior.

[TechnoType]OmniCrusher.Aggressive=boolean
  Whether or not a unit should try to crush its target aggressively. If
  no, the unit will not try to come as close as possible to the target
  to finally crush it. Requires OmniCrusher=yes. Defaults to yes.

   Only supported if OmniCrusher=yes is set. The default might
    change in a later version.
