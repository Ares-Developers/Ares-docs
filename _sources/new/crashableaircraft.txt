Crashing


 Aircraft; Non-Crashable aircraft

Crashable and Aircraft


Any AircraftType being destroyed in air would explode and crash, causing
damage on the ground. A tag, Crashable, exists, but it only works for the
other TechnoTypes, so aircraft cannot be made to not crash. Ares
adds support for Crashable=no and aircraft.

[AircraftType]Crashable=boolean
  Whether the aircraft will explode and fall down crashing into the ground when
  destroyed. Otherwise the aircraft will explode in mid-air and disappear.
  Defaults to yes.

 Aircraft; Spinning while crashing

Spinning


Aircraft that is going to crash starts to spin uncontrollably. For larger planes
this can look silly and Ares adds an option for this to turn it off.

[AircraftType]CrashSpin=boolean
  Whether the aircraft should spin when crashing, opposed to gliding down to the
  ground. Defaults to yes.

   This setting only works for aircraft. JumpJet=yes
    VehicleType\ s do not support it.
