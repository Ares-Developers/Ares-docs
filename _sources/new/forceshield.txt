Force Shield


Like the Iron Curtain the Force Shield duration can be customized for each
BuildingType.

[BuildingType]ForceShield.Modifier=float - multiplier
  The number of seconds of Force Shield duration is multiplied by this value.
  Valid values are 0% (Force Shield disallowed) or higher. Defaults to
  100%.

   Buildings with a ForceShield.Modifier value of 0.0
    or less are not eligible to fire a Force Shield super weapon on.
