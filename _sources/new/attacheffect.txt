AttachEffect


The AttachEffect system was designed as a spiritual successor to
NPatch's Upgrade logic, but it was aimed to not be limited only to
superweapons. AttachEffect tags can be applied to both the Big Four (all
TechnoTypes) and Warheads, unless stated otherwise.

 The state of AttachEffects on units does not update while in a
  transport, while under a temporal effect and so on. In this matter, they
  behave like IvanBombs.

 To create a healing/repairing or residual damage effect, attach
  an animation with appropriate Warhead and Damage settings. This
  will affect the target unit for the entire duration of the AttachEffect,
  applying damage using the animation damage mechanism.

[Section]AttachEffect.Animation=AnimationType
  The optional animation to play on the affected unit. The animation is attached
  to the unit and moves along with it. Defaults to none.

  The animation is removed when the unit is cloaked. The animation is recreated
  once the unit is uncloaked again. While cloaked, the AttachEffect is still
  applied, but the effects caused by the animation are not.

   The animation always loops until the effect subsides.
    LoopCount is ignored.

[Section]AttachEffect.Duration=integer
  The duration of the effect in frames. Use -1 for infinite duration.
  Defaults to 0.

[Section]AttachEffect.TemporalHidesAnim=boolean
  Whether a TechnoType with this type of AttachEffect applied on it
  should remove the animation while being warped out by a Temporal=yes
  weapon. Otherwise the animation stays active and unaffected by the temporal
  weapon. Defaults to no.

[Section]AttachEffect.SpeedMultiplier=float - multiplier
  Speed bonus while the AttachEffect lasts. Defaults to 1.0.

[Section]AttachEffect.ArmorMultiplier=float - multiplier
  Armor bonus while the AttachEffect lasts. Defaults to 1.0.

[Section]AttachEffect.FirepowerMultiplier=float - multiplier
  Firepower bonus while the AttachEffect lasts. Defaults to 1.0.

[Section]AttachEffect.Cloakable=boolean
  Whether the unit gains cloaking ability while the AttachEffect lasts. Defaults
  to no.

[Section]AttachEffect.ForceDecloak=boolean
  Whether affected units will be forced to decloak when the AttachEffect gets
  applied (useful for non-damaging anim-based AttachEffects). Defaults to
  no.

[Section]AttachEffect.DiscardOnEntry=boolean
  Whether the AttachEffect will be removed when the affected unit is removed
  from the map (entering a building or another unit). Defaults to no.

The following tags are valid on TechnoTypes only:

[TechnoType]AttachEffect.Delay=integer
  Defines how many frames after the previous effect subsides the AttachEffect is
  recreated on the unit itself. Negative values do not renew the effect.
  Defaults to 0 (immediately).

The following tags are valid on Warheads only:

[Warhead]AttachEffect.Cumulative=boolean
  If set to yes, an unlimited amount of this type of AttachEffect from
  this warhead can be applied to the target (it is stackable). If no,
  only one instance of this type of the AttachEffect can be on a single unit and
  that one instance gets updated if it is to be applied again. Defaults to
  no.

[Warhead]AttachEffect.AnimResetOnReapply=boolean
  If this type of AttachEffect is not stackable, enabling this flag resets the
  animation on every time of reapplying. Defaults to no.
