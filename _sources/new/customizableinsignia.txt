Veterancy Insignia


Chevrons


Units can now have custom insignia (chevrons) to represent their veterancy
level.

[TechnoType]Insignia.Rookie=filename, excluding the .shp extension

[TechnoType]Insignia.Veteran=filename, excluding the .shp extension

[TechnoType]Insignia.Elite=filename, excluding the .shp extension
  For example, Insignia.Rookie=SAMPLE would display sample.shp as
  the insignia while the object is rookie. Defaults to PIPS.

These SHPs - like the original pips.shp - are expected to be in the
theater palette. If you specify an insignia, the first frame of its SHP will be
drawn. Veteran and Elite objects without the insignia specified will still
display the 15th/16th frames of pips.shp as usual.

[TechnoType]InsigniaFrame.Rookie=integer - frame

[TechnoType]InsigniaFrame.Veteran=integer - frame

[TechnoType]InsigniaFrame.Elite=integer - frame
  The frame used from the insignia shape. Set to -1 to use the default
  frame index.

Hiding Enemy Insignia


Because you usually cannot ask enemy troops what their rank is, and from a
distance they look all the same anyhow, you can also disable displaying insignia
on enemy units by using the following tags.

[General]EnemyInsignia=boolean
  Whether insignia will be shown for enemy players by default. Each unit type
  can override this value. Defaults to yes.

[TechnoType]Insignia.ShowEnemy=boolean
  Whether insignia for a unit of this type will be shown for enemy players.
  Defaults to [General]â–ºEnemyInsignia.

 Observers will always be able to see insignia of all players.
