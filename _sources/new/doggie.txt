Tiberian Fiends


Tiberian Sun had wildlife, which was yet more aggressive than Red
Alert 2's cows. Among them was the Tiberian Fiend, which hid in patches of
Tiberium and could attack and heavily damage units and structures on the
battlefield. Ares recreates this remarkably nasty piece of fauna.

  the unit will not sit down on Tiberium, as well as NotHuman=yes to not
  show human death animations when killed. Defaults to no.
