Tiberian Fiends


Tiberian Sun had wildlife, which was yet more aggressive than Red
Alert 2's cows. Among them was the Tiberian Fiend, which hid in patches of
Tiberium and could attack and heavily damage units and structures on the
battlefield. Ares recreates this remarkably nasty piece of fauna.

players to be overrun by Tiberian Fiends without retaliating automatically.

[InfantryType]Doggie=boolean
  Whether this unit exhibits Tiberian Fiend behavior: Sitting down on Tiberium
  when in guard mode, aborting attack missions and running for Tiberium when
  badly hurt, and being easily aggravated. Requires Crawls=yes, otherwise
  the unit will not sit down on Tiberium, as well as NotHuman=yes to not
  show human death animations when killed. Defaults to no.
