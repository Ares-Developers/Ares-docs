Player @ X Support for Multiplayer Map Events


Map events have been expanded to support Player @ X numeric constants
4475 to 4482 for the multiplayer participants 1 to 8. If a
constant does not resolve to a valid player (that is, the player slot is not
empty and the player has not been defeated yet), the game will not crash any
more like before. Instead, the event will just not fire.

 \ ScriptTypes, TeamTypes, and TriggerTypes
  still do not support ownership using Player @ X logic.
