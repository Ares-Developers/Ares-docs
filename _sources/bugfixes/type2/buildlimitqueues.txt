 BuildLimit; Last unit with BuildLimit>1 could not be queued


BuildLimit and Queues


The vehicle or infantry currently in production was counted twice, and thus the
BuildLimit check triggered too early if a unit of the same type was
already in production. Once the build queue was empty again, the last unit could
be queued normally. This has been fixed.
