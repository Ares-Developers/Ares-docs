DestroyAnim\ s Don't Remap


The remappable parts of animations played via the use of the DestroyAnim
flag (when a building is destroyed) used to remain red in color -- they would
not get remapped to the owning player's house color. Now they will.

 The game files already include suitable animations for some buildings,
  however some of these (the Allied Barracks and Prism Tower) use the red
  palette indexes rather than the remappable indexes so you will need to recolor
  the images.
