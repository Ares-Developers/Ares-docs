 Ammo; Infantry and buildings will now reload ammo properly.


BuildingTypes and InfantryTypes Do Not Reload Ammo Properly


See Ammo on ModEnc  for exact
details of this problem. Put simply, ammo/reloading logic did not work properly
on BuildingTypes or InfantryTypes and was essentially useless
on those object types. Ares fixes this logic such that these object
types will now reload their ammo properly. Note that AircraftTypes are
hard-coded to require docking to reload.

 \ Hospital=yes and Armory=yes buildings still do not
  reload ammo.
