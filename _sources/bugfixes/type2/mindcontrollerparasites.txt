 Parasites; Mind-controller parasites will no longer draw the mind-control link


Mind-Controller Parasites


MC-parasites would draw a mind-control link between the mind-controlled unit and
the point on the map where the parasite entered the unit. Now the link will not
be drawn at all. You can also use MindControl.Permanent instead, in order
to use the perma-mc animation.
