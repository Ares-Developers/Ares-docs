  Vehicles; Paradrop works correctly
  Paradrops; Vehicles are paradropped correctly


Vehicle Paradrop Offset


Passengers of AircraftTypes get paradropped out if the
AircraftType fires its weapon. The passengers would always use the
infantry sub-cell positions for where they would be spawned, even if the
passenger were not an InfantryType. This ultimately meant that vehicles
would appear to fall part-way into the ground upon landing. This error no longer
happens in Ares.

The same problem also used to occur with vehicles paradropped from aircraft
with Carryall=yes set.
