 Mirage; Turrets and barrels will be disguised with the unit


Mirage Logic with Turrets/Barrels


In Yuri's Revenge, using the Mirage disguise logic on a
VehicleType with Turret=yes would result in the vehicle's turret
not being disguised. Ares fixes this behavior so that associated turrets
and barrels will be disguised along with the unit's body.
