 Carryalls; Facing issues fixed


Carryall Cargo Fixes


Carryalls messed with cargo units in a way that would change their rotation
speed. This was because the Carryall's current facing along with its ROT
value was forced upon the cargo to give the impression that it is actually
mounted below the aircraft. When dropping off the cargo, the original values
were not restored. Ares now does this. Also, the facing in which the
cargo is dropped off has been changed to be the same as the Carryall facing.

 0.D

When a Carryall releases its cargo, it will go on guard mission instead of
sitting there frozen. If it was part of a team previously, it will try to rejoin
that team. If the unit cannot be placed on the map, it is now put back into the
Carryall, instead of potentially disappearing.
