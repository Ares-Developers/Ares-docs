Destroyable Cliffs


In Tiberian Sun, destroyable cliffs could be made to collapse with any
weapon. In Yuri's Revenge, destroyable cliffs are still targetable, but
only particle weapons like the rail gun or sonic weapons were able to damage
cliffs and make them collapse into ramps.

Ares fixes this, so any weapon can make destroyable cliffs collapse.
[CombatDamage]â–ºCollapseChance= is respected.
