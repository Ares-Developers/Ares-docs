.. index:: Terrain; Destroyable cliffs can be destroyed by non-particle weapons.

==================
Destroyable Cliffs
==================

In :game:`Tiberian Sun`, destroyable cliffs could be made to collapse with any
weapon. In :game:`Yuri's Revenge`, destroyable cliffs are still targetable, but
only particle weapons like the rail gun or sonic weapons were able to damage
cliffs and make them collapse into ramps.

:game:`Ares` fixes this, so any weapon can make destroyable cliffs collapse.
:tag:`[CombatDamage]CollapseChance=` is respected.
