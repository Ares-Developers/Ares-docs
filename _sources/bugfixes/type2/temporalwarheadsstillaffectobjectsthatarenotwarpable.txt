Temporal Warheads Still Affect Objects That Are Not Warpable


Attacking a unit with a Temporal=yes warhead when it should not be
susceptible due to having Warpable=no set, could still experience some
negative effects. Units that were mind-controlled by the unwarpable unit would
be freed and aircraft-spawners would have those aircraft destroyed. Unwarpable
units are no longer affected in this manner.
