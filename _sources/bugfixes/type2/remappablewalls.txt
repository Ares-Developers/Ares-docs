Remappable Walls


Walls (i.e. OverlayTypes with Wall=yes) were always rendered in
the remap colors of the current player (the human playing on this computer),
instead of using the remap color of the wall's actual owner. Ares will
instead draw walls' remappable sections in their respective owner's colors.
