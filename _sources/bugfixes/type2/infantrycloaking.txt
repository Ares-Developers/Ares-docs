 Cloak; Infantry will not constantly uncloak and cloak during an attack mission


Cloakable Infantry Constantly Uncloaking


When cloakable infantry received an attack order, they would uncloak even if the
target was not in range, then cloak again. This would happen until they came
close enough to the target. Vehicles on the other hand did not have this problem
and they would only uncloak when necessary. Ares applies the vehicles'
behavior to infantry, too.
