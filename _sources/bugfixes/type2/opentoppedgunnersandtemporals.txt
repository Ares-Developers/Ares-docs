OpenTopped Gunner\ s and Temporal weapons


Gunner=yes vehicles use the passenger's temporal device to fire if it is
equipped with a Temporal=yes weapon. This can be done safely, and the
device is replaced once the infantry exits the vehicle. If the Gunner=yes
vehicle is also OpenTopped=yes, the infantry with the Temporal=yes
weapon inside is still supposed to fire on its own, but because it doesn't have
the temporal device any more, the game crashes.

Ares prevents infantry that has its temporal device taken away by the
Gunner logic from firing out of an OpenTopped vehicle.
