  Subterranean; Nuke super weapons using DigSound for their siren


DigSound


[AudioVisual]►DigSound is used for both the global Nuke siren and the
sound made when a subterranean unit (with
Locomotor={4A582743-9839-11d1-B709-00A024DDAFD1}) digs into or emerges
from the ground. With Ares, the super weapon can specify its own
SW.ActivationSound (which defaults to [AudioVisual]►DigSound
for nukes).
