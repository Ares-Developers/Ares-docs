Play Sound at Random Waypoint


The map action `Play Sound at Random Waypoint` collected up to 400 waypoints
from which it then randomly selected one to play a sound effect at. This could
crash, because it had actually only space to store 100 waypoints. If there were
more waypoints present on the map, the game would crash. This has been fixed.
