 Crashes; Loose pips files in game's folder causes crash exit


Crash with Loose SHP Files


Because of a bug it was not possible to have the files pipbrd.shp,
pips.shp, pips2.shp, and talkbubl.shp loose in the
game's folder. If any of them were present, the game would crash when exiting.
This is fixed.
