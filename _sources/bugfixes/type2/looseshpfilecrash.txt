==========================
Crash with Loose SHP Files
==========================

Because of a bug it was not possible to have the files :file:`pipbrd.shp`,
:file:`pips.shp`, :file:`pips2.shp`, and :file:`talkbubl.shp` loose in the
game's folder. If any of them were present, the game would crash when exiting.
This is fixed.
