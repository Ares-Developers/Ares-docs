SpyPlane Count Decoupled From AllyParaDropNum


If you set [General]â–ºAllyParaDropNum to a list of integers so as to send
multiple InfantryTypes in the paradrop (and thus multiple paradrop
planes) then the SpyPlane super weapon would also send the same number of planes
as there were elements in that list. In Ares, the number of spy planes
sent out is now specified by the super weapon's own SpyPlane.Count flag
(which defaults to 1).
