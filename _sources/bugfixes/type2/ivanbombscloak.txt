 Ivan Bombs; Ivan Bombs will not damage cloaked Ivans


Ivan Bombs and Cloaked Ivans


In Yuri's Revenge, a unit delivering damage is immune to this damage,
unless stated otherwise by DamageSelf=yes. If an Ivan cloaked after
placing a bomb, the bomb 'forgot' who planted it. Thus, the Ivan was not counted
as the source of the damage once the bomb exploded, and thus it could take
damage from it. Ares prevents this from happening, and cloaking Ivans
are now as immune to their own bombs as non-cloaking Ivans are.
