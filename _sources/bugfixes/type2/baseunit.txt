 Sides; BaseUnit can now hold more than 3 vehicles


BaseUnit


[General]â–ºBaseUnit specifies the list of VehicleTypes that are
considered to be MCVs. Only the first 3 entries of this list were recognized by
the game, which means that additional sides would never be playable in non-Short
Games (among other limitations). Ares removes this limit so all entries
in the list are now recognized.
