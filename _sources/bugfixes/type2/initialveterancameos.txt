Initial Veteran Cameos


When you infiltrate, say, an enemy Barracks, any (trainable) infantry that you
subsequently build will start veteran. The infantry's cameos (build icons) will
gain the veteran symbol to indicate this. However, if the country you are
playing as has any units that always 'start veteran' then those units did not
gain the veteran symbol for their cameos. Now they do.
