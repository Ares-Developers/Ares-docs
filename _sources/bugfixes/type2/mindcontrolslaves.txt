 Slaves; Slaves change ownership if their enslaving unit does


Slaves Change Ownership If Enslaver Switches Sides


In Yuri's Revenge the Slave Miner was the only unit that enslaved
InfantryTypes, and it was immune to mind-control and couldn't be
captured. If it could be captured however, you would notice the slaves wouldn't
change their ownership along with the vehicle - they would stay on the original
owner's side.

In Ares, slaves will also change their ownership if their enslaving unit
is captured or mind-controlled.
