 Spawners; NoSpawnAlt and Turret


NoSpawnAlt and Turret


To store the spawn-less voxel, spawner units with NoSpawnAlt=yes used the
same storage space normally used for turrets. Thus, spawner units which should
have a spawn-less voxel cannot also have a turret at the same time.

Ares reworked this feature and makes it possible to combine turrets and
spawn-less voxels.
