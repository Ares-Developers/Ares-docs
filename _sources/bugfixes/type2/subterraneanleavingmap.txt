Subterranean Units Could Accidentally Leave The Map


The Tunnel Locomotor which handles subterranean units contained a bug that
caused units to move out of the map. If triggered, the unit would turn around to
face the top-left corner, burrow into the ground, and then travel underground
into the same direction. Eventually, the unit would be destroyed. This bug is
fixed.
