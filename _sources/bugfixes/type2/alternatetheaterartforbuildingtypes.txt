 Theaters; Alternate Theater Art for all BuildingTypes regardless of first letter


Alternate Theater Art For BuildingTypes


BuildingTypes whose artmd.ini entry has NewTheater=yes
set would have the second letter of their SHP filenames replaced by another
letter, depending on the theater of the current map. For example,
[GAWEAP]â–º uses SHP files named GAWEAP* on arctic maps,
GTWEAP* on temperate maps, GDWEAP* on desert maps and so on. In
the event that a SHP file with the appropriate filename does not exist, the game
falls back to GGWEAP*.

However, in Yuri's Revenge this filename-adjusting logic only works for
BuildingTypes whose Image ID starts with G, N, Y or C.
Ares extends this logic to work for Image IDs starting with any
letter (A-Z or a-z).
