 Gap Generators; Radius can be greater than 127 cells


Gap Generator Radius can be greater than 127 Cells


Due to Yuri's Revenge using a too small data type, the radius for the
Gap Generators could not be greater than 127 cells. Ares reimplemented
the tags and now GapRadiusInCells= and SuperGapRadiusInCells=
support greater values.

 Use this new freedom with caution. Including too many cells can cause
  lag.
