BuildingType Upgrades Are Not Viable Prerequisites


Before Ares, upgrades did not appear to work as prerequisites -- if you
had the upgrade, you still didn't satisfy the prerequisite. In fact, only the
most recently constructed BuildingType would be checked to see if it had
the upgrade. With Ares, all upgrades on all BuildingTypes are
eligible to satisfy any prerequisite logic that a normal BuildingType
can.

In addition, upgrades can now satisfy a super weapon's AuxBuilding.
