 Chronosphere; Amphibious objects no longer sink when chronoshifted onto water


Amphibious Objects Sink When Chronoshifted Onto Water


When an amphibious (not hover) object - that is, one that can normally enter
water cells without problem - was chronoshifted onto water by the Chronosphere,
it would sink. Ares corrects this so that all amphibious objects can be
chronoshifted onto water without sinking.
