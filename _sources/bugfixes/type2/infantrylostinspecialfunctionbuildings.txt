Infantry Lost In Special Function Buildings


Infantry sent into an Armory or old-style Tech Hospital emerge a few moments
later, having had the relevant benefit applied (e.g. promotion or healing).
However, if the building were destroyed, sold or undeployed whilst the
InfantryType were still inside then that InfantryType would
remain in 'limbo' whilst still counting towards the owning player's units (e.g.
defeat conditions, build limit, etc). Ares will make sure that such
InfantryTypes are ejected from the building in those situations.
