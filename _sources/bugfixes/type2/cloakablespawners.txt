 Cloak; Spawner units can be cloakable


Cloakable Spawners


The moment a Spawner=yes unit cloaked, all spawns would be destroyed and
had to respawn, because the spawns did not differentiate between a carrier going
out of sight or being destroyed.

Ares changes this and it is now possible to have cloakable Aircraft
Carriers or Destroyers. Spawned aircraft will not crash when the spawning unit
cloaks.
