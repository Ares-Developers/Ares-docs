 Free Unit; Support for units other than Harvesters


Free Unit Initial Mission


Refinieries usually come with free Harvester units, which are automatically
assigned the Harvest mission. The game does the latter even if the Free Unit is
no Harvester.

Ares sets non-Harvesters on an Area Guard mission.
