 Aircraft; Attack other aircraft if given a weapon with an AA=yes projectile


Air-To-Air Combat


Anti-air weapons (where the projectile has AA=yes set) could not be used
by AircraftTypes -- aircraft simply would not attack other airborne
units. Now, anti-air weapons work just fine on aircraft. No additional flags are
required.
