 Walls; Gates can be slammed onto any walls not just GAWALL or NAWALL


Hardcoded Wall/Gate Interactions


In Tiberian Sun you could place buildable gates on top of existing
walls. This logic still exists in Yuri's Revenge. However, the logic was
hardcoded to only work with [GAWALL]► and [NAWALL]►, so it wouldn't
work with Yuri's wall ([YAWALL]►) or, indeed, any other walls you might
add to the game. Ares changes this so that all overlays with
Wall=yes set can have gates "slammed" onto them.

 The automatic joining of walls to the gates still only works for
  GAWALL and NAWALL however this will be fixed in future.
