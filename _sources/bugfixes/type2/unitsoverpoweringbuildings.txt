 Overpowering; Vehicles can overpower buildings


Units overpowering buildings


Tesla Troopers, for example, can overpower Tesla Coils to make them fire a more
powerful weapon. If the same logic were applied to vehicles (for example, the
Tesla Tank), to make them overpower buildings in the same way, then the
overpowering weapon of the vehicle would fire but would not, in fact, overpower
the building. Now vehicles can overpower buildings properly.
