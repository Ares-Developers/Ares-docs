 Secret Labs; Buildable secret labs will now have a boon


Buildable Secret Labs


Secret Lab boons were picked on map load so if a Secret Lab were not pre-placed
on the map then it would not provide a boon. With Ares,  Secret Labs
constructed by a player will randomly pick a boon that that player could not
build at the time the Secret Lab was placed.
