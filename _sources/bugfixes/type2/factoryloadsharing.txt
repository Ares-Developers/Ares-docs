 Factories; Factory load sharing for factories of the same type


Factory Load Sharing


If you had queued up a lot of vehicles such that the primary factory could not
cope with the rapid exit cycle then the game would search for alternative exits
-- other instances of the same BuildingType. In Ares this has
been extended to search for all BuildingTypes with the same
Factory and Naval settings.

 This fix prevents the kennel hack as described on ModEnc
   from
  working. See ... for a solution.
