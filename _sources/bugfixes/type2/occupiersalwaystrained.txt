 Veterancy; Occupiers with Trainable=no are no longer trained


Occupiers are always trained even if Trainable=no


Units occupying civilian structures or Battle Bunkers unconditionally gain
experience from kills even if Trainable=no is set. In the original game,
GIs, Conscripts and Initiates are all Trainable=yes, and thus the problem
does not arise. Ares fixes this.
