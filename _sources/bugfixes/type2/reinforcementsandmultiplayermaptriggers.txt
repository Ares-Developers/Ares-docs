Reinforcements and Multiplayer Map Triggers


Using the `Player@X` logic, Yuri's Revenge would also try to reinforce
players that don't exist, which leads to a crash. When using `Reinforcement`,
`Reinforcement at Waypoint` and `Reinforcement by Chrono` map actions,
Ares will only create a team if the player exists on the map.
