AmbientDamage=0 Still Dealt Damage


Railguns with AmbientDamage=0 would still deal damage, and even though it
would deal 0 hitpoints, this would count as an attack. Certain buildings would
special-case a damage of 0 and ensure at last 1 hitpoint of damage is dealt.
This does not happen anymore, and Ares lets the game skip the damage
dealing altogether, so Railguns can now be used just for visual purposes.
