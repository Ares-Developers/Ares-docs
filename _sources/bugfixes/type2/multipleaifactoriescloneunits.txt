 AI; Control over AI's multiple factory-cloning behavior


Multiple AI Factories Clone Units


If the AI were modified to build multiple factories of the same type then every
time they built a unit from that factory type they would produce a copy of that
unit from every additional factory. For example, if the AI were made to build a
second War Factory then they would get a second copy of every vehicle they
build. This behavior can be disabled in Ares, by the following flag:

[GlobalControls]AllowParallelAIQueues=boolean
	Set this to no to disable AI factory cloning. Defaults to yes.


 AI; Force AI to respect BuildLimit


AI ignores BuildLimit when creating teams


In the original game the AI did not respect a unit's BuildLimit tag when
creating teams. Ares changes this to disallow the AI from creating a
team if any unit's build limit would have to be violated. This new tag gives you
a way to restore the original behavior.

[GlobalControls]AllowBypassBuildLimit= list of boolean
	Allows AI to bypass build limits to create teams. This list is ordered by
	difficulty: easy, medium, hard. Use yes to let the AI bypass build
	limits. Defaults to no,no,no.
