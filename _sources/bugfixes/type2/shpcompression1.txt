Shape Compression 1 Draws Vertical Lines on Large Images


In-game Yuri's Revenge originally only fully supported compressed shape
images up to a width of 256 pixels. The game used a buffer of fixed size with
additional data while drawing, and larger images read past the end of that
buffer. The vertical lines were a consequence of random data being applied to
each line drawn, selectively making the pixels at the same x coordinates
transparent.

This has been fixed. Ares uses a large enough buffer to draw compressed
shape images.
