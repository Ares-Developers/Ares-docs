 Cloak; Units don't uncloak if they aren't affected by a warhead


Cloaked Objects no Longer Uncloak if Unaffected


Cloaked objects being hit by warheads that dealt no damage to them or even
healed them uncloaked briefly. It was unintuitive for friendly warheads to
reveal units and structures to the enemy. Ares changed this behavior so
healing weapons and weapons dealing no damage will no longer uncloak objects.
