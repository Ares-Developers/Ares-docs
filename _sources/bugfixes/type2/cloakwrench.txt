 Cloak; Repair animation will not show


Repair Wrench Revealing Cloaked Structures


The wrench animation appearing when a building is being repaired could give away
building positions to enemies as it was visible for everyone even if the
structure was cloaked. This has been fixed and buildings will not show the
repair animation while cloaked. Observers will still see the wrench, though.
