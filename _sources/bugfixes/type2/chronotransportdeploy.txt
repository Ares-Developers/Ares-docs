 Units; Inconsistent Chrono-Transport deploy behavior


Chrono-Transport Deploy Inconsistency


If armed vehicles using the teleport locomotor carry passengers, they cannot
deploy using the keyboard or the Advanced Command Bar while still phasing in
after a move order. Yet, using the mouse on the vehicle gives the deploy cursor
and, when clicked, the passengers are ejected successfully. This inconsistency
has been resolved and phasing in vehicles are not allowed to deploy any longer.
