Custom Palettes


The original game supports custom palettes on TechnoTypes using
Palette (filename, excluding .pal extension) on the TechnoType's
entry in artmd.ini. However, the game would crash (with the message "You
have violated the limit of having only one extra building Palette" in the
[non-existent] log file) if you used the Palette flag more than once.
And, of course, the one extra palette was already in use on the Statue of
Liberty. Ares removes this limit and lets you use custom palettes on all
TechnoTypes to your heart's content.

 It is not known why this apparently arbitrary limit on custom palettes
  was in place -- it may have been there to mask a bug that we don't yet know
  about.

 When using custom palettes, the modder must make a new palette for
  each theater. Normally, each building or unit has an associated palette for
  each theater it can be deployed into (e.g. unitsno.pal,
  unittem.pal, etc). If the modder creates a new palette, say
  "picasso.pal", in order for that palette to be used in other theatres, the
  modder must create "picassosno.pal", "picassotem.pal", etc as well.
