  Veterancy; C4 Veteran Ability restored


C4 Veteran Ability


The C4 veteran ability did not work correctly in Red Alert 2
and Yuri's Revenge. Even though infantry could be ordered to use the C4
gained through veterancy, it could not blow up buildings. This has been fixed
and the ability now works as it did in Tiberian Sun.
