 Weapons; Sonic wave ambient damage comes from the correct weapon (instead of always Primary)


Sonic Wave Ambient Damage


The Warhead and AmbientDamage settings used when applying ambient
damage from a sonic weapon were always taken from the unit's current primary
weapon rather than the weapon that actually fired the wave. Now these settings
are taken from the weapon that fired the wave.
