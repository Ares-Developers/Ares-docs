 OpenTopped; Entering/leaving water sounds plays when infantry is transported


Unit Sounds Played At Inappropriate Times


When an InfantryType with MovementZone=AmphibiousDestroyer was
carried between water and land inside an 'open topped' vehicle (e.g. a Nighthawk
converted into a flying Battle Fortress), their EnterWaterSound
/ExitWaterSound would be played. Now, these sounds will only be played
when the InfantryType themselves physically enters/leaves water.
