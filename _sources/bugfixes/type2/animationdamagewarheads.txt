 Animations; Animations' Warhead= flag now works


Animation Damage Warheads


Animations may have appeared to deal damage randomly rather than based on the
warhead specified. In fact, animations were hard-coded to deal damage using the
warhead specified by [CombatDamage]►FlameDamage2, unless the animation ID
was [INVISO]►, in which case the warhead used
[CombatDamage]►C4Warhead. With  Ares, the
[Animation]►Warhead flag will be adhered to, with the aforementioned
warheads used as the default if [Animation]►Warhead is not specified.
