New Construction Options


One cause of the NCO bug (where the EVA will announce "new construction options"
when, in fact, there aren't any) was the game's failure to check if the player
had the appropriate factory type to build the unit concerned (e.g. a
VehicleType factory for VehicleTypes). Such a check will now
take place, thus removing this cause of the NCO bug.

Another cause of the NCO bug is when a house is not listed as a
buildable building's owner. Ares's prerequisite system does not check
for that, thereby eliminating this type of bug.

Owners still affect AI base planning.
