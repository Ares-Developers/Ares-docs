 EVA; EVA will always announce Low Power now unrelated to [AI]>BuildConst.


BuildConst


If you get into low power then the EVA will announce 'low power', but only if
you have one of the first 3 buildings from the [AI]â–ºBuildConst list. With
Ares, you'll get the EVA announcement if you have any building from the
list.
