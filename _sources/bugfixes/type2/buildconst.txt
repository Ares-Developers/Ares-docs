  Sides; EVA will always announce Low Power now unrelated to BuildConst
  EVA; Low Power announcement plays not just for the first three sides


BuildConst


If you get into low power then the EVA will announce 'low power', but only if
you have one of the first 3 buildings from the [AI]â–ºBuildConst list. With
Ares, you'll get the EVA announcement if you have any building from the
list.
