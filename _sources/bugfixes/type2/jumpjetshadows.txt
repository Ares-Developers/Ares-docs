 Jumpjets; Shadows on jumpjet not drawn correctly when the unit is airborne


Jumpjet Shadows


If a Jumpjet vehicle uses SHP-based imagery then the shadow would only be drawn
when the unit was at rest on the ground or if Turret=yes were set (and
then the shadow would appear directly underneath the unit instead of on the
ground). Now the shadow will always be drawn correctly on the ground.
