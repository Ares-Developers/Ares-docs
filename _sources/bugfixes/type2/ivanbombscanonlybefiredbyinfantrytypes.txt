.. index:: Ivan Bombs; Ivan bombs can be fired by any unit (instead of just infantry).

=====================================================
Ivan Bombs Can Only Be Fired By :type:`InfantryTypes`
=====================================================

If an Ivan Bomb weapon was given to any unit other than an :type:`InfantryType`
then the weapon would fire but the Ivan Bomb would not actually get attached to
the target. Now Ivan Bombs can be fired by :type:`VehicleTypes`,
\ :type:`AircraftTypes` and :type:`BuildingTypes` as well.

.. note:: \ :type:`BuildingTypes` do not get the Dynamite cursor.
