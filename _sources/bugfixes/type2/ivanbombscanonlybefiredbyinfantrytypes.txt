 Ivan Bombs; Ivan bombs can be fired by any unit (instead of just infantry)


Ivan Bombs Can Only Be Fired By InfantryTypes


If an Ivan Bomb weapon was given to any unit other than an InfantryType
then the weapon would fire but the Ivan Bomb would not actually get attached to
the target. Now Ivan Bombs can be fired by VehicleTypes,
AircraftTypes and BuildingTypes as well.

 \ BuildingTypes do not get the Dynamite cursor.
