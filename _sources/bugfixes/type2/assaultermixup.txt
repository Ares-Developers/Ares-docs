Assaulter Mix Up


The game accidentally switched assaulter infantry and victim infantry when an
Assaulter infantry raided a building. This messed with several logics as
well as with the internal bookkeeping counters, registering the wrong unit as
destroyed. A consequence was that the assaulter could be registered as lost
multiple times instead of the occupants inside the building, which could fail
missions because critical units were apparently lost. This bug has been fixed.
