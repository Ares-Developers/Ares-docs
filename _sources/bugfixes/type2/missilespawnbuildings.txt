 Spawns; MissileSpawn on buildings


MissileSpawn on Buildings


Buildings were able to use Spawns logic only as long as the spawned
AircraftType had MissileSpawn=no set, thus could only spawn
aircraft like the Destroyer and the Aircraft Carrier. If a building were to
spawn a missile, the game would crash. Ares fixed the missile handling
and thus MissileSpawn=yes no longer crashes the game.
