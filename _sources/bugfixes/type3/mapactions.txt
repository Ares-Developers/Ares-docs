Inefficient Map Events


Map events `TechType exists` and `TechType does not exist` were implemented
inefficiently. Both iterated all available types each frame to resolve an ID to
a type and then iterated all technos to count the number of existing technos of
this type. Ares caches the type information. Ares also optimizes
summing up the techno count by using the house counters of each house, if the
type is Insignificant=no and DontScore=no.
