Inefficient Map Events


Map events `TechType exists` and `TechType does not exist` were implemented
inefficiently. Both iterated all available types each frame to resolve an ID to
a type and then iterated all technos to count the number of existing technos of
this type. Ares always caches the type information and also optimizes
summing up the techno count by either using the house counters of each house, if
the type is Insignificant=no and DontScore=no or at least only
checking the list of the relevant object type otherwise.
