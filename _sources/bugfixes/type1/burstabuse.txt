 Exploit; Burst abuse is fixed


Burst Abuse


If a unit with a multiple burst weapon (Burst > 1) destroys its
target or is assigned a new target before it has fired all shots, the game
resets the burst counter, but does not also restart reloading. The result is
that the unit can attack the next target immediately, with a fresh set of
bursts.

Given that the delay between bursts is usually shorter than the reload time,
this gives an unfair advantage. Given that manually changing targets or issuing
a Stop command also resets the burst counter, this can be exploited.

Ares fixes this by not resetting the burst counter.

 This might be changed in the future to also restart reloading.
