  Super Weapons; Fix for AI wasting its Force Sield
  Exploits; The AI can be tricked to use up their Force Shield unnecessarily


Force Shield and AI Exploit


There is a probability an AI player uses the Force Shield super weapon to defend
against a super weapon fired on its base by an enemy player. This also happened
when the enemy player was not even allowed to fire the super weapon, maybe
because another Lightning Storm was already active at the moment.

If a super weapon was active, a player owning a charged super weapon of the same
type could use it and quickly click on all enemy players' bases to make them use
their Force Shield to defend against a super weapon that had its fire sequence
aborted, causing them to lose power for a short amount of time.

This easily exploitable bug has been fixed and the AI will now only defend
against super weapons that were actually fired.
