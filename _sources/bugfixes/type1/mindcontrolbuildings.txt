Mind-Controlled Buildings Stopped Working When Freed


If a mind-controller captured a building and it was either freed or the
mind-controller let go of it, the building would just sit there, doing nothing.
They didn't even retaliate when fired upon previously. This was because freed
units are supposed to go on a hunt mission. Buildings cannot go hunting and so
they stayed lethargic.

Now the freed building will be put on guard.
