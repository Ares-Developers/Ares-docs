Occupiers Are Promoted Only After Exiting Building


Infantry could gain experience killing enemies while occupying a structure, but
unlike units in OpenTopped vehicles (and with Ares with
Gunner vehicles also), occupiers are not promoted immediately. They had
to exit the building first, and only after doing this would they use the elite
weapon when occupying a structure again.

With Ares, the promotion now happens immediately and without exiting,
but it is silent, that is, no sound will play.
