 Behavior; Anti-air units like IFVs will not chase aircraft in Guard


Units in Guard Mission Will not Chase Aircraft


Units in Guard mission might leave their position to chase after enemy aircraft.
The IFV of the vanilla game is notorious for this kind of behavior, breaking
formation and leaving the area it should defend against air attacks undefended,
often easily lured into an ambush itself.

This behavior is fixed in Ares and units on Guard mission will no longer
leave their position to pursue aircraft when the aircraft goes out of range.
Mind that this fix only applies to Guard missions, not Area Guard missions.
