Super Weapon Option Affected Campaigns


The option to disable super weapons in multiplayer matches had an effect on
single player missions also. Thus there was a possibility that players could not
use super weapons and could not even build the buildings providing those super
weapons if they were DisableableFromShell=yes. Other options like the
redeployable MCV feature are explicitly prevented from affecting campaigns. Such
checks have been added for the super weapon option also, and thus super weapons
will always be available in campaign mode.
