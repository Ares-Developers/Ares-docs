 Glitches; Infantry jamming when using area attack


Infantry Deploy Glitch


Under certain circumstances, Deployer=yes infantry units with an
UndeployDelay greater than or equal to zero get jammed. This for instance
made the Yuri Clone helplessly hover in air for half a minute after using its
Area Fire deploy attack.

Due to a hole in the state machine for that mission, the game would fall back to
what appears to be the default handling to make such holes obvious. Ares
plugs that hole.
