Selling Buildings Exploits


In Yuri's Revenge selling buildings could be exploited to give free crew
infantry or to create a virtual MCV which could not be destroyed, the latter
keeping the exploiting player alive forever.

When a re-deployable Construction Yard was sold, it could be ordered to move
somewhere while packing up, and the sell order would be converted to a move
order. The crew was still ejected from selling, and the player also kept the
MCV. If the MCV could not be placed on the map, it would still be kept alive in
memory, unable to be destroyed. If the building was destroyed while being sold,
it would eject crew a second time.

Ares does no longer allow a sell order to be converted into a move
order, and it will also not eject crew twice in case the building is destroyed
while selling. Ares also makes sure the MCV is placed on the map, or it
will be taken out of the game, no longer keeping players alive.
