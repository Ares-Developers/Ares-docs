Visual Effects Switched Off Erratically


When the frame rate drops, the game tries to increase it again by turning off
certain visual effects like lasers, waves, and electro bolts, and some
animations with DetailLevel=2. Lasers will fall back to draw a simpler
variant using a bold line, animations disappear, and so on. When the frame rate
increases again, the effects are turned back on.

This did not happen if the game speed is set to a slower frame rate, because
then it would always be detected as too low. Ares fixes this, and the
visual effects will render with high quality even in slower game speeds.
