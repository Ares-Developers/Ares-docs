.. index:: Chronosphere; EVA report when aborting target selection

============================================================
Aborting the Chronoshift announces the Chronosphere as ready
============================================================

When the Chronosphere SW is used to select a source location and the target
selection is then aborted, EVA would report the Chronosphere as ready again,
even though it was never actually discharged. This does not happen any more.
