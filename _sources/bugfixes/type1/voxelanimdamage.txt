Voxel Animation Damage Issues


Voxel Animation damage delivery had two bugs. Firstly, passed its Damage
data on the type directly, without making a copy first. The type data thus could
change during the course of the game, and the type of Voxel Anim would do less
and less damage over time. Secondly, the game could crash if the Voxel Animation
had no Warhead defined.

Both issues have been fixed in Ares.
