 Bugs; Voxel Animations dealt less and less damage over time


Voxel Animation Damage Issues


Voxel Animation damage delivery had two bugs. Firstly, it passed its
Damage data on the type directly, without making a copy first. The type
data thus could change during the course of the game, and the type of Voxel Anim
would do less and less damage over time. Secondly, the game could crash if the
Voxel Animation had no Warhead defined.

Both issues have been fixed in Ares. If no warhead is set, the Voxel
Animation will not deliver any damage.
