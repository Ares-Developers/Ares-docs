Temporal Warheads Gain Double Experience


Killing a unit using a weapon with a Temporal=yes warhead gained the
attacker twice the experience it deserved. This was because the temporal weapon
updated the killer's experience and then went on calling a game function that
did the same.

Ares removes the temporal weapon's veterancy update, so this no longer
happens.
