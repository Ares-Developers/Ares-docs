 Bugs; MulitplayPassive houses anger AI players


MultiplayPassive=yes Houses Anger Players


AI players pick their favorite enemy by detecting which enemy player caused the
most damage and destruction. If the neutral houses caused some damage near the
start of the match (which could also happen if Oil Derricks blew up), AI players
might pick a neutral house as their enemy to go after and thus start a war
against civilians.

With Ares, MultiplayPassive=yes countries are no longer eligible
to be picked as favorite enemy.
