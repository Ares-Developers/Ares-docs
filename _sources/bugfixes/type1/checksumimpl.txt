 Coding; Out of bounds array access when hashing


Checksummer Implementation Error


The code generating checksums to compare game state to detect desynchronisations
had a bug and wrote into memory beyond class bounds. It is not clear whether
this caused any trouble, as memory management is highly dynamic and depends on
too many factors like OS version, other running programs, and game state. In any
case, this was a coding error which has been fixed.
