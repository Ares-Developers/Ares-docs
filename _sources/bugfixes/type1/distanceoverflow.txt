Distance Calculation Causes Overflow


Some distance calculations, for example used to find a viable docking building
like a refinery, an airport, or a Service Depot, could overflow, which would
lead to far away structures be preferred even to structures right next to the
searching unit. This has been fixed in a way that all distances are maxed at the
largest value, so all very far away buildings are now considered equally bad.
