Firing Voices and Veterancy

Yuri's Revenge uses different unit voice lists for firing weapons
(VoicePrimaryWeaponAttack, VoicePrimaryEliteWeaponAttack,
VoiceSecondaryWeaponAttack and VoiceSecondaryEliteWeaponAttack).
If the *EliteWeaponAttack list is empty, VoiceAttack is used
instead of the more appropriate non-elite version *WeaponAttack.

This behavior makes units like Boris, Magnetrons, Siege Choppers, Boomers and
Floating Discs lose their special voices once they become elite. Ares
falls back to the non-elite weapon firing voices instead of using the generic
VoiceAttack ones.
