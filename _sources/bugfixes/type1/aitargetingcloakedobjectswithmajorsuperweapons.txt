AI Targeting Cloaked Objects With Major Super Weapons


When AI controlled super weapons with Type=LightningStorm,
Type=MultiMissile, Type=PsychicDominator, and
Type=GeneticConverter picked their target, they failed to ignore cloaked
objects (such as Submarines) and, as a result, sometimes selected them as
targets, ruining the appearance of fair play. Cloaked objects are no longer
considered as targets for these super weapons.
