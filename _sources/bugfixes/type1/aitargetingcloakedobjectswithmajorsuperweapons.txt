AI Targeting Cloaked Objects With Major Super Weapons


When AI controlled super weapons with Type=WeatherStorm or
Type=Nuke picked their target, they failed to ignore cloaked objects
(such as Submarines) and, as a result, sometimes selected them as targets,
ruining the appearance of fair play. Cloaked objects are no longer considered as
targets for these super weapons.
