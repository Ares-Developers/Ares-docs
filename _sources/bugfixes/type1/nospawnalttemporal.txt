NoSpawnAlt and Temporal Warheads


NoSpawnAlt=yes units always displayed their spawn-less body voxel when
attacked by Temporal weapons: When a Chrono Legionnaire attacked a
Destroyer, its docked Osprey would disappear the moment the vessel froze. This
does not happen any more and spawner units will now always use the body voxel
displaying their proper state.
