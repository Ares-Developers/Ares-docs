 Load Screens; Separate load screen text colors for each faction


Load Screen Colors


Westwood did not update the code that selects the load screen text color for
Yuri's Revenge. The original campaigns always used SovietLoad
red no matter what faction you played as. For the multiplayer game modes,
everything that was not Allied got SovietLoad red, too. Ares
selects these values: Allies get AlliedLoad blue for campaigns and Yuri
gets either the new YuriLoad or Purple as fallback in
multiplayer.
