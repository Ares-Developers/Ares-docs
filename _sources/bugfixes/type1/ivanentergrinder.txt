Crazy Ivans Cannot Enter Grinders


Crazy Ivan always got the Ivan Bomb cursor on an allied Grinder and thus could
not be ordered to enter it normally. Once the Grinder was rigged with a bomb,
Crazy Ivan was allowed to enter it. Force fire or force move keys could not
alter this behavior.

Ares changes this so Crazy Ivan gets the enter cursor on allied Grinders
by default. Enemy Grinders get the Ivan Bomb cursor. You can still override this
behavior if you want to plant a  bomb on a Grinder by pressing the force fire
key.
