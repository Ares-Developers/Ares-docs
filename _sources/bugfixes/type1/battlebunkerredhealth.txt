Infantry Cannot Enter Battle Bunkers in Red Health


Occupiable neutral structures are abandoned by their occupants when they are
damaged to red health. As long as the building isn't repaired, no infantry could
occupy it again. Battle Bunkers will not throw out their occupiers once they
reach red health, though new infantry still could not enter them.

This has been changed so infantry is still allowed to enter Battle Bunkers when
in red health.
