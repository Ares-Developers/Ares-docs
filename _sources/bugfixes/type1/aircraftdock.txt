Aircraft Can Be Manually Docked to Structures


Players were not allowed to manually select which structure aircraft was docked
to in Yuri's Revenge. This has been fixed and players can land aircraft
on any structure that is in the AircraftType's Dock list.

The mouse will now show either the enter or no-enter cursor if a structure is in
Dock, otherwise the select cursor is used.
