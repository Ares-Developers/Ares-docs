  Glitches; Tech structures start to play active animations when damaged


Tech Structures and Animations


NeedsEngineer controls whether a tech building is offline until it is
captured by an engineer. Until then, it should not play any active animations,
yet when a building with NeedsEngineer=yes was damaged into yellow health
and switched to the damaged graphics, the animations started to play as if it
had been captured. This did not affect the functionality, though. With
Ares the animations will not start to play in this case.
