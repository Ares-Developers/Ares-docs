Temporal Warheads Earn Experience By Killing Friendly Units


When a unit kills an enemy unit it gains experience, which can lead to that unit
becoming veteran or elite. Killing friendly units (your own or your allies')
does not earn experience in this way.

However, *Temporal* warheads (warheads with Temporal=yes set) *did* use
to earn experience when killing friendly units. This is no longer the case.
