Disappearing Ivan Bombs


Ivan Bombs attached to a unit just vanished when the unit deployed into a
building and vice versa. The bomb would also disappear if a rigged building
changed its owner. If a building was sold while a bomb was attached to it, the
bomb was sold along with it, without being triggered.

Ares transfers the bomb in such cases and prevents the bomb from getting
lost in the process. If a unit or building is sold, the bomb will now go off.
