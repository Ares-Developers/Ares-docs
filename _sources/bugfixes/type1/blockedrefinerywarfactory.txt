Blocking Enemy Refineries and War Factories


Vehicles could be made to stand on the bib of enemy refineries and war factories
and block them. If the owner would try to destroy these vehicles, it would be
the underlying building that would take the damage. Ares changes this so
enemy units can no longer pass the passable cells of those buildings.
