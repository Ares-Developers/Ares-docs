Warhead Verses' Special Values


The Verses flag (which is used on warheads to manipulate the damage dealt
versus different armor types) has three special-case values used to define
additional behavior:

0%
  means no force fire, no retaliate, no passive acquire
1%
  means no retaliate, no passive acquire
2%
  means no passive acquire
  
However, a bug with the way the floating-point values are compared means that
these behaviors were not always applied consistently. Ares fixes this
bug so the behavior should always be consistent now. The special behaviors can
also now be toggled independently of the Verses value (see
...).
