  Exploits; Stop command no longer works on berserking units
  Bugs; Berserking units still respect the Stop command


Chaos Gas (Psychedelic=yes) and the Stop Command


Units under the influence of Chaos gas (from warheads with
Psychedelic=yes) were supposed to act on their own and not take any
orders from their owners, yet a player was still able to use the stop command on
them. This could prevent berserking units from attacking and damaging friendly
units and thus soften the psychedelic effect. This is no longer possible.
