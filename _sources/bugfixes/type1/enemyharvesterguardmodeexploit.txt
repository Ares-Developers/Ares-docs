  Bugs; Enemy harvesters can be ordered into guard mode


Enemy Harvester Guard Mode Exploit


It was possible to issue the 'guard mode' order to enemy harvesters as if they
were your own units. Players unaware of this exploit would find their economy
crippled when facing an unscrupulous player. It is no longer possible to issue
the guard mode order to enemy harvesters.
