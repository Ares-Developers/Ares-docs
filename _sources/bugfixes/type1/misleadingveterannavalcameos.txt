 Spies; Spying a war factory will not give you veteran build icons for naval units incorrectly.


Misleading Veteran Naval Cameos


When you infiltrate an enemy War Factory, any (trainable) VehicleTypes'
(not AircraftTypes) cameos (build icons) will gain the veteran symbol,
indicating that they will start veteran when built. However, only vehicles built
from a War Factory will actually start veteran, not vehicles built from a Naval
Yard. Ares ensures that only the vehicles that will actually start veteran gain
the veteran symbol for their cameos.
