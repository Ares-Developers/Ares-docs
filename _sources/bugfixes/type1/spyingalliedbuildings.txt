Spying on Allied Buildings
==========================

In :game:`Yuri's Revenge` players are not supposed to infiltrate own or allied
buildings, yet it was possible to order a spy to do so. When a spy entered a
building that was owned by a player allied to the spy owner, the spy effects
would still apply. This could be exploited easily. :game:`Ares` prevents this.
