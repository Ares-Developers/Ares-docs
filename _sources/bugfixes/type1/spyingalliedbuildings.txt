Spying on Allied Buildings


In Yuri's Revenge players are not supposed to infiltrate own or allied
buildings, yet it was possible to order a spy to do so. When a spy entered a
building that was owned by a player allied to the spy owner, the spy effects
would still apply. This could be exploited easily. Ares prevents this.
