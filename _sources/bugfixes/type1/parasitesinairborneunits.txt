Parasites In Airborne Units


If a parasite (e.g. Terror Drone) entered a unit that can fly (e.g. Nighthawk)
and that unit was destroyed by the parasite whilst airborne then the parasite
would appear, unscathed, on the ground beneath the destroyed unit. In
Ares, the parasite will instead appear at the same height as the
destroyed airborne unit and fall to the ground - where it will be destroyed by
the impact.

 \ JumpJet=yes parasites are not supported yet and also fall to
  the ground like other parasites.
