.. index:: Parasites; Parasites that destroy an airborne unit will fall to the ground and be destroyed too.

===========================
Parasites In Airborne Units
===========================

If a parasite (e.g. Terror Drone) entered a unit that can fly (e.g. Nighthawk)
and that unit was destroyed by the parasite whilst airborne then the parasite
would appear, unscathed, on the ground beneath the destroyed unit. In
:game:`Ares`, the parasite will instead appear at the same height as the
destroyed airborne unit and fall to the ground - where it will be destroyed by
the impact.
