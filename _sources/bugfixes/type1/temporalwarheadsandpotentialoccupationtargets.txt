Temporal Warheads and Potential Occupation Targets


If a player ordered infantry to occupy a neutral structure, and the building was
erased with a Temporal warhead before the potential occupiers could
arrive, an Internal Error would occur. Ares fixes this behavior so that
erasing the structure will no longer trigger a crash.
