:captiontag:`Temporal` Warheads and Potential Occupation Targets
================================================================

If a player ordered infantry to occupy a neutral structure, and the building was
erased with a :tag:`Temporal` warhead before the potential occupiers could
arrive, an Internal Error would occur. :game:`Ares` fixes this behavior so that
erasing the structure will no longer trigger an error.
