Bug Fixes

Ares provides three types of bug fixes:

#. Fixes to genuine bugs in the original, unmodded Yuri's Revenge 1.001,
   which cannot be fixed simply by modifying INI files or graphics (like the UMP
   does).
#. Fixes to logic that goes unused in the unmodded game, or at least not used to
   its full capabilities -- i.e. game logic that often does not work as expected
   when used in mods.
#. Corrections and enhancements to code efficiency that reduce loading times and
   in-game lag without affecting gameplay mechanics. Also hardware/operating
   system related crashes.
   
 Restored features from Tiberian Sun have their own category and are not considered fixed bugs under any of these
   definitions, particularly 2.
