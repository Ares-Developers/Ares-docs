 Infantry; VehicleThief logic without workarounds


Vehicle Thief


With Ares you can create vehicle thieves like the Mutant Hijacker from
Tiberian Sun without having to use Thief=yes,
Infiltrate=yes or Agent=yes also. The logic was amended to allow
for some customization the original game didn't support.

See the ... section for details.
