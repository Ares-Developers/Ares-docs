Multi Engineer


Red Alert introduced a way to balance engineers. By being able to
capture a building only if has been damaged already engineer rushes became a lot
more difficult. If the building could not be captured the engineer would damage
it instead. EngineerDamage is not present in Yuri's Revenge.
Ares restores this feature.

[General]EngineerCaptureLevel=float - percent
  If the building's health is equal to or below this percentage of its strength
  it can be captured by an engineer instead of being damaged. Defaults to
  1.0.
[General]EngineerDamage=float - percent
  If the building cannot be captured the engineer will damage it by this amount
  of its full health. Defaults to 0.0.
[General]EngineerAlwaysCaptureTech=boolean
  Specifies whether tech buildings can be captured no matter what their current
  health status is. Defaults to yes.

   All structures originally owned by countries with
    MultiplayPassive=yes are considered tech structures. This
    definition  is likely to change in a later version.

 Use sensible defaults. Generally, EngineerDamage should never
  be higher than EngineerCaptureLevel or there might be situations an
  engineer blows up the building to be captured.

See ... to enable the user to turn the Multi
Engineer option on and off from the game menu. If the checkbox is not enabled,
the game will enforce the settings defined in rulesmd.ini.

See Mouse Cursors on how to customize the cursor to
indicate an engineer will only damage the building instead of capturing it by
defining EngineerDamage.
