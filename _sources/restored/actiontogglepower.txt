 Actions; An Action=TogglePower super weapon no longer causes IE when targetting an empty cell.


Action=TogglePower


In Tiberian Sun there was a button on the sidebar that allowed players
to turn their own buildings on and off and in low power situations. In
Yuri's Revenge, a super weapon with Action=TogglePower achieves
the same function. However, if such a super weapon were fired into an empty cell
then an Internal Error would occur. Ares prevents the error occurring.
