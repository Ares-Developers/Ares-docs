Multi Engineer Checkbox


Tiberian Sun lets the user enable and disable the Multi Engineer feature
from the user interface. Ares restores this feature. If the user turns
off Multi Engineer in the skirmish menu, buildings can always be captured using
an engineer, otherwise the settings in rulesmd.ini are used.

This tag goes into uimd.ini:

[UISettings]AllowMultiEngineer=bool
  Specifies whether the user can turn the Multi Engineer feature on and off from
  the menu. Defaults to no. If the checkbox is not shown the settings
  in rulesmd.ini will be enforced.

See ... for more info on EngineerDamage and
EngineerCaptureLevel.

 Currently only the skirmish menu supports changing the Multi Engineer
  option. This will be changed in the future to support network and online games
  as well.
