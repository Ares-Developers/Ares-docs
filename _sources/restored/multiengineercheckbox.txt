Multi Engineer Checkbox


Tiberian Sun lets the user enable and disable the Multi Engineer feature
from the user interface. Ares restores this feature. If the player turns
off Multi Engineer in the skirmish menu, buildings can always be captured using
a single engineer, otherwise the settings in rulesmd.ini apply.

This tag goes into uimd.ini:

[UISettings]AllowMultiEngineer=boolean
  Specifies whether the user can turn the Multi Engineer feature on and off from
  the menu. Defaults to no. If the checkbox is not shown the settings
  in rulesmd.ini will be enforced.

  The checkbox uses `GUI:MultiEngineer` as its caption.

See ... for more info on EngineerDamage and
EngineerCaptureLevel.

 Currently only the skirmish menu supports changing the Multi Engineer
  option. This might be changed in the future to support network and online
  games as well.
