Spotlights


Spotlights are now available to all of the Big Four types, not just
BuildingTypes. When attached to a BuildingType, the spotlight
still behaves like it used to, just circling around, but when it is attached to
a different unit type, such as a VehicleType, it is fixed to shine
straight ahead.

Spotlights would cause an Internal Error whenever they were created. The error
no longer occurs so spotlights can now be used.

If an object with a spotlight cloaked, the spotlight was removed and would not
reappear once the object uncloaked. This doesn't happen anymore. The spotlight
will be invisible while the object is cloaked, deactivated, being warped out, or
burrowed, though.

[TechnoType]HasSpotlight=boolean
  If set to yes, creates a spotlight from the unit or structure.
  Defaults to no.
[TechnoType]Spotlight.StartHeight=integer - leptons
  Specifies the number of leptons above the ground at which the spotlight will
  be generated. Has to be 0 or greater. Defaults to 430.
[TechnoType]Spotlight.Distance=integer - leptons
  The number of leptons ahead of the unit where the spotlight will reach the
  ground. Defaults to 1024.
[TechnoType]Spotlight.AttachedTo=enumeration - one of body|turret
  The part of the unit that the spotlight will align to in regards to facing. If
  set to body then the spotlight will be pointed in the direction the
  unit's body is facing, if set to turret then the spotlight will be
  pointed in the direction the unit's turret is facing. Does not work on
  BuildingTypes. Defaults to body.

  Defaults to no.
[TechnoType]Spotlight.DisableColor=boolean

  instead of brighter, and the disable red/green/blue flags mentioned above will
