Spotlights


Spotlights would cause an Internal Error whenever they were created. The error
no longer occurs so spotlights can now be used.

[Unit]HasSpotlight=boolean
  If set to yes, creates a spotlight from the unit (note that this is
  now available to all of the Big Four types, not just BuildingTypes).
  When attached to a BuildingType, the spotlight still behaves like it
  used to, just circling around, but when it is attached to a different unit
  type, such as a VehicleType, it is fixed to shine straight ahead.
  Defaults to no.
[Unit]Spotlight.StartHeight=integer - leptons
  Specifies the number of leptons above the ground at which the spotlight will
  be generated. Defaults to 250.
[Unit]Spotlight.Distance=integer - leptons
  The number of leptons ahead of the unit where the spotlight will reach the
  ground. Defaults to 1024.
[Unit]Spotlight.AttachedTo=enumeration - one of body|turret|barrel
  The part of the unit that the spotlight will align to in regards to facing. If
  set to body then the spotlight will be pointed in the direction the
  unit's body is facing, if set to turret then the spotlight will be
  pointed in the direction the unit's turret is facing. Does not work on
  BuildingTypes. Defaults to body.
[Unit]Spotlight.DisableRed=boolean
  If set to yes then the spotlight will not emit any red light.
  Defaults to no.
[Unit]Spotlight.DisableGreen=boolean
  If set to yes then the spotlight will not emit any green light.
  Defaults to no.
[Unit]Spotlight.DisableBlue=boolean
  If set to yes then the spotlight will not emit any blue light.
  Defaults to no.
[Unit]Spotlight.DisableColor=boolean
  If set to yes then the spotlight will paint the ground darker,
  instead of brighter, and the disable red/green/blue flags mentioned above will
  be ignored. Defaults to no.
