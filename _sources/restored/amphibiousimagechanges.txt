Amphibious Image Changes

In Tiberian Sun, the Amphibious APC would appear to sink into the water.
This was achieved by changing the imagery from apc.vxl to
apcw.vxl. With Ares, you can now specify:

[VehicleType]WaterImage=VehicleType
  This allows the amphibious unit's image to change from XXXX.shp or
  XXXX.vxl (defined by Image=) to YYYY.shp or
  YYYY.vxl (defined by [WaterImage]►Image=) when in water, similar
  to UnloadingClass.

  Please note that SHP units cannot have a voxel WaterImage, and vice
  versa. The VehicleType has to be defined under [VehicleTypes]►.
