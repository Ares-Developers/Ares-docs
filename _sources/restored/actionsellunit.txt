 Super Weapons; SellUnit super weapon no longer causes IEs with Tank Bunker


Action=SellUnit


In Tiberian Sun you could sell units that were docked with a structure
by using the normal Sell button on the sidebar. In Yuri's Revenge, a
super weapon with Action=SellUnit achieves the same function. However, if
such a super weapon were fired on a unit inside a Tank Bunker then an Internal
Error would occur (sometimes this would be delayed until the destruction of the
Tank Bunker). Ares prevents the error occurring.
