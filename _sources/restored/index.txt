Restored Tiberian Sun Logic

The Yuri's Revenge engine is based on the Red Alert 2 engine,
which, in turn, is based on the Tiberian Sun engine. Various features
that existed in Tiberian Sun were removed in Red Alert 2, and
further features were removed in Yuri's Revenge and in the 1.001 patch.

The extent to which these features no longer exist in Yuri's Revenge
1.001 varies, from not functioning correctly to complete removal of the logic
(sometimes because simply using the logic causes an Internal Error).

Note that, in many cases, Ares has drastically changed the way these
features are implemented.

.. no index, should be in the new feature category
