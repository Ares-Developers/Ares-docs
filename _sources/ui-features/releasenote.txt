 Mods; Release note printed on-screen

Release Note


If your mod is still in early development stage or in testing phase, you can
make Ares display a release note in the lower left corner of the screen.
The text can contain the current version, warnings or other details. It will
appear in-game as red text on black background.

The release note is the text in the CSF files labeled TXT_RELEASE_NOTE.
Include a string with this label in a stringtable file (not in
ra2md.csf) to enable the text.

 \ Ares includes an empty text for this label to ensure the
  string can be found and "MISSING:TXT_RELEASE_TEXT" is not displayed on the
  screen.
