 Mods; Specify mod name and version

Mod-specific Information


The following settings describe your mod and give it a name and a version
number to uniquely identify your mod. These tags are important for savegames to
distinguish files from different mods or different versions of the same mod, and
they are also printed out in debug.log to aid diagnosing problems.

It is highly recommended to set those to meaningful individual values.

Both can be defined in uimd.ini:

[VersionInfo]Name=string
  The name of the modification in unspecified format. Maximum 63 characters.
  Defaults to Yuri's Revenge.
[VersionInfo]Version=string
  The version of the modification in unspecified format. Maximum 63 characters.
  Defaults to 1.001.
