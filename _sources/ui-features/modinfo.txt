Mod-specific Information


The following settings describe your mod and give it a name and a version
number to uniquely identify your mod. These tags are at the moment purely
diagnostic - they are not shown anywhere in game, but they will be printed out
in debug.log.

Both can be defined in uimd.ini:

[VersionInfo]Name=string
  The name of the modification in unspecified format. Maximum 63 characters.
  Defaults to Yuri's Revenge.
[VersionInfo]Version=string
  The version of the modification in unspecified format. Maximum 63 characters.
  Defaults to 1.001.
