Random Map Generator


Ares lets you create random maps using some new map styles --
Archipelago terrain and the Desert tileset.

The RMG will now place bridges at random on maps that include rivers.

Random Map Generator enhancements:

A new checkbox -- `Place Urban Areas` -- allows the user to add an assortment of
streets and urban combat buildings at random spots throughout the generated map.
The objects placed by this feature can be modified by adding the heading
[URBAN]â–º in the rgdmd.ini file, and adding the following lists
after Structure=, Vehicles= and Infantry= respectively:

[URBAN]Structures=list of BuildingTypes
  Defaults to CABUNK01,CABUNK02,CAARMY01,CAARMY02,CAARMY03,CAARMY04,
  CACHIG03,CANEWY01,CANEWY14,CANWY09,CANWY26,CANWY25,CATEXS07.
[URBAN]Vehicles=list of VehicleTypes
  Defaults to TRUCKA,TRUCKB,COP,EUROC,SUVW,SUVB,FTRK,AMBU.
[URBAN]Infantry=list of InfantryTypes
  Defaults to CIV1,CIV2,CIV3,CIVA,CIVB,CIVC.

 Urban areas generated in the minimap preview do not always correspond
  to content generated ingame, especially in Desert maps -- this is still being
  investigated. In addition, there are reports of this feature not working at
  all with certain settings. (Known issue: #794
