Random Map Generator


Ares lets you create random maps using some new map styles --
Archipelago terrain and the Desert tileset.

The Random Map Generator will now place bridges at random on maps that include
rivers.

Random Map Generator enhancements:

A new checkbox -- `Create Urban Areas` -- allows the user to add an assortment
of streets and urban combat buildings at random spots throughout the generated
map. The objects placed by this feature can be modified by adding the heading
[Urban]► in the rmgmd.ini file, and adding the following lists:

[Urban]Structures=list of BuildingTypes
  Defaults to CABUNK01,CABUNK02,CAARMY01,CAARMY02,CAARMY03,CAARMY04,
  CACHIG03,CANEWY01,CANEWY14,CANWY09,CANWY26,CANWY25,CATEXS07.
[Urban]Vehicles=list of VehicleTypes
  Defaults to TRUCKA,TRUCKB,COP,EUROC,SUVW,SUVB,FTRK,AMBU.
[Urban]Infantry=list of InfantryTypes
  Defaults to CIV1,CIV2,CIV3,CIVA,CIVB,CIVC.

 Urban areas generated in the minimap preview do not always correspond
  to content generated ingame, especially in Desert maps. In addition, there are
  reports of this feature not working at all with certain settings.
