Campaign List


If you have more campaigns than the game's default Campaign Selection menu
supports you can switch to a campaign list as in Tiberian Sun.
Ares supports an arbitrary number of campaigns. Every non-debug battle
listed in battlemd.ini will show up in the list under the name defined
by Description=.

Enable the campaign list in uimd.ini:

[UISettings]CampaignList=boolean
  Enables the campaign list instead of the game's default menu. Defaults to
  no.
[UISettings]ShowDebugCampaigns=boolean
  Also displays campaigns in the list that have `DebugOnly=yes` set. Defaults to
  no.


You can customize the campaigns in the list by editing battlemd.ini:

[Battle]HoverSound=sound
  The sound to be played when the player selects a campaign. This defaults to
  AlliedCampaignSelect, SovietCampaignSelect, and
  BootCampSelect for the original in-game campaigns. The selection menu
  plays them when the mouse hovers over the respective campaign's image.
[Battle]Summary=CSF label
  Provide an optional summary about the story of the campaign. It will be shown
  below the difficulty slider.
