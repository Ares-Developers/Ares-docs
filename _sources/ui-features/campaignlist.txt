Campaign List


If you have more campaigns than the game's default Campaign Selection menu
supports you can switch to a campaign list as in Tiberian Sun.
Ares supports an arbitrary number of campaigns. Every non-debug battle
listed in battlemd.ini will show up in the list under the name defined
by Description=.

Enable the campaign list in uimd.ini:

[UISettings]CampaignList=boolean
  Enables the campaign list instead of the game's default menu. Defaults to
  no.
[UISettings]CampaignListSize=integer
  The number of campaigns shown in the Campaign list without scrolling. The
  number of campaigns shown cannot be less than 3. The maximum number
  depends on ShowSummary. Defaults to 7.
[UISettings]ShowSummary=boolean
  Whether the campaign list displays a campaign's Summary below the
  difficulty selection. If shown, the maximum campaign list size is 14,
  otherwise it is 18. Defaults to yes.
[UISettings]ShowDebugCampaigns=boolean
  Also displays campaigns in the list that have `DebugOnly=yes` set. Defaults to
  no.


You can customize the campaigns in the list by editing battlemd.ini:

[Battle]HoverSound=sound
  The sound to be played when the player selects a campaign. This defaults to
  AlliedCampaignSelect, SovietCampaignSelect, and
  BootCampSelect for the original in-game campaigns. The selection menu
  plays them when the mouse hovers over the respective campaign's image.
[Battle]Summary=CSF label
  Provide an optional summary of the campaign's or mission's story. It will be
  shown below the difficulty slider if not disabled using
  [UISettings]â–ºShowSummary.
