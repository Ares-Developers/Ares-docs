 Savegames; Save games per mod and version

Save Games


Only save games made with the same version of either the vanilla game or a mod
and a compatible version of Ares are supported. All incompatible
save games will be hidden from the list of saved games automatically.

 Save games work like in the unmodified game: they are stored in the
  game folder and have a random filename with a .sav extension. This
  might change in future versions.

For save games to work properly, mods are required to set the mod-specific
information settings to values uniquely identifying each
individual mod version. To ensure that save games correctly restore the previous
state of the game, you need to make sure to change the mod version whenever you
make changes to global settings or data.

Those include:

  * changing the order of existing sounds, EVA messages, and themes in the INI
    files (this includes adding new items into the middle of as well as removing
    any items from the lists)
  * changing filenames of files used for terrain or object (buildings, units,
    projectiles, animations, ...) art, or changing the number of image frames
    contained in such files

Failing to do so might prevent the game from correctly restoring the previous
state. This might cause subtle issues ranging from the wrong sounds being played
to graphical glitches, but it could also cause crashes.

If Ares detects a mismatch while reading its own data and is thus unable
to proceed loading a save game file, it will automatically and forcefully
terminate the game, no error message will be shown, and the game will not return
back to the main menu. This should not happen if you follow these guidelines.
For debugging purposes, the log file will then contain information about the
last object Ares tried to restore.
