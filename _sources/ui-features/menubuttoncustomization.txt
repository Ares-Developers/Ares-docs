Menu Button Customization


Change some menus to hide certain buttons that don't fit your mod like the
Campaign and Play Movies buttons. The default button action will be overridden
by the action you defined. You are not limited to just disable the button.

The following buttons can be affected by editing uimd.ini. They default
to default.

[UISettings]SinglePlayerButton=action
  The main menu button that leads to the Single Player menu.
[UISettings]NetworkButton=action
  The main menu button that leads to the Network menu.
[UISettings]WWOnlineButton=action
  The main menu button that leads to the Westwood Online menu.
[UISettings]MoviesAndCreditsButton=action
  The main menu button that leads to the Movies And Credits menu.
[UISettings]CampaignButton=action
  The Single Player menu button that leads to the Campaign selection menu.
[UISettings]SkirmishButton=action
  The Single Player menu button that leads to the Skirmish menu.
[UISettings]SneakPeeksButton=action
  The Movies And Credits menu button that starts the sneak peek video.
[UISettings]PlayMoviesButton=action
  The Movies And Credits menu button that leads to the Movies menu.
[UISettings]ViewCreditsButton=action
  The Movies And Credits menu button that starts the Credits roll.


The following action values are valid:

  :default: Do not change the action of this button.
  :disable: The button stays where it is, but it won't be clickable.
  :hide: The button will be hidden. The following buttons are moved so there will
    be no empty space.
  :message: Clicking the button will show a message box with an *OK* button and
    TXT_X_MSG as its text. X equals the flag's name.
  :credits: Clicking the button starts the credits roll.
  :sneakpeek: Clicking the button starts the sneak peek video.


Examples:

+ For mods without campaign support CampaignButton=hide will hide the
  campaign selection button. The menu buttons are reordered automatically so the
  Skirmish button takes its place.
+ Mods without movies can use PlayMoviesButton=hide.
+ If you don't have a preview or sneak peek video either you can define
  MoviesAndCreditsButton=credits to show your credits roll from the
  main menu. This works best if you change its caption also.
+ You can tell the player of your team if you define
  ViewCreditsButton=message and set the string
  TXT_VIEWCREDITSBUTTON_MSG to your short copyright message.
