 Interface; Single-click exit without confirmation

Exit Without Confirmation


The game always asks the player for confirmation when clicking the Exit Game
button in the main menu. So, players have to click twice before the game
actually closes. Ares adds an option to change this extra step.

In uimd.ini:

[UISettings]QuickExit=boolean
  Whether the game shall exit immediately when clicking the Exit Game button.
  Otherwise a message box is shown and the player can still abort closing the
  game. Defaults to no.
