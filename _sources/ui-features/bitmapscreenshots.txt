 Screenshots; Screenshots saved as BMP files rather than PCX

Bitmap Screenshots


With Ares active, screenshots are now generated as BMP files rather than
PCX. BMP files are smaller in size and are more widely supported.

The screenshot function now generates timestamped filenames instead of
sequential ones, to avoid progressively longer delays as the output directory
gets full.
