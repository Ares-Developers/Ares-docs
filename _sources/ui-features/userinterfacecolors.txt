User Interface Colors


To complement the graphical user interface elements Yuri's Revenge
relies on a set of hardcoded colors. Customize the colors used to draw texts and
borders with these Ares tags.

All these uimd.ini tags are RGB colors, that is three comma separated
values from 0 to 255.

Please note the special combobox (dropdown list) state for dropdown lists in
Observer mode, that is it has its Observer entry selected.
Yuri's Revenge uses grey colors and special graphical elements to denote
this state. Changing the global values will not change the Observer colors,
you'll have to define the specific Color.Observer.* tags.

  The first color control borders are drawn in. Defaults to
  167,190,197.
[UISettings]Color.Border2=R,G,B
  The second color control borders are drawn in. Defaults to
  104,122,128.
