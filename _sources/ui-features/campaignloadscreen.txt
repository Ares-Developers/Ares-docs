Campaign Load Screen


Text Color


Yuri's Revenge always draws single player campaign load screen texts in
red. Ares uses the correct values, inferred by the mission name prefix.
You can override these defaults for each mission using this new
missionmd.ini tag.

[Mission]LoadScreenText.Color=Color scheme
  Text on the campaign loading screens for this mission will be drawn using this
  color from the [Colors]â–º list. For example,
  LoadScreenText.Color=AlliedLoad.

 Interface; Campaign load screen text color customizable per mission.
