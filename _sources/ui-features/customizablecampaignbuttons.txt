Customizable Campaign Buttons


With Ares you can have up to four campaign buttons on Yuri's
Revenge's campaign selection menu and customize all of them in
uimd.ini.

You can customize all campaign buttons using these uimd.ini tags by
replacing X by the numbers from 1 to 4:

[UISettings]CampaignX=battle
  The mission from battle.ini started by clicking the image button. To
  hide a button set CampaignX=no. Defaults to ALL1,
  SOV1, TUT1 or no respectively.
[UISettings]CampaignX.Image=filename, *including* the .shp extension
  The 260x136 image shown on the campaign selection menu. Have a look at
  fsalg.shp to see an example. Defaults to fsalg.shp or
  fsslg.shp respectively.
[UISettings]CampaignX.Palette=filename, *including* the .pal extension
  The palette used to render the image. Defaults to fsalg.pal,
  fsslg.pal or fsbclg.pal respectively.
[UISettings]CampaignX.Subline=CSF label
  The subline displayed beneath the campaign image. To override the default
  value set this to a label containing no text. Defaults to
  STT:AlliedCampaignIcon, STT:SovietCampaignIcon or
  STT:CampaignAnimTutorial respectively.
[UISettings]CampaignX.Tooltip=CSF label
  The text displayed as tooltip when the player hovers over the image. To
  override the default value set this to a label containing no text. Defaults to
  CampaignX.Subline.

Ares defaults to the original game's values so you don't have to change
anything. To display a third button just add the above tags for
Campaign3.

Three buttons are arranged in a triangle formation: one centered in the upper
row, two in the lower one. If you want to have an upside-down triangle, skip
Campaign3 and use Campaign4 instead. Four campaigns are always
ordered left to right, top to bottom.

To control the sound that is played when the player hovers over the image see
HoverSound= on ....

 If you want to have a third campaign button to start the
  tutorial mission, set [UISettings]â–ºCampaign3.Image=fsbclg.shp. You will
  have to rework that image, as there is no Yuri's Revenge style version
  of it.
