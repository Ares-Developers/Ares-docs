 Skirmish; Single player skirmish without any computer opponent

Lone Player and Single Team Skirmish


You can now start a single player skirmish game without any AI opponent. This is
primarily used for testing a mod without having to worry about the AI attacking
you.

You can set all players to fight for the same team. Mind that if one AI player
is defeated, the match will end.
