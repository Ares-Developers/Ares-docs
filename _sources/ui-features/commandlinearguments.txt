Command Line Arguments


:-CD: Allows the game to run without the Yuri's Revenge CD. Requires the
  content of the Yuri's Revenge CD to be copied to the Red Alert
  2 directory first. The First Decade users already have all the
  required files installed, so no further action has to be taken.
:-NOLOGO: Prevents the EA logo video from playing before the game begins to
  load.
  
   Launch Base has its own option to just prevent the video playing for
    mods that do not include their own video.
:-LOG: Turns debug.log file writing on initially. See Internal
  Errors/Debugging.
:-LOG-CSF: Outputs all CSF labels that cannot be found in the language files
  into debug.log. Each label is written only once, and prefixed with
  [CSFLoader].
:-STRICT: Throws an Internal Error on game load if a not-necessarily-critical
  error is detected. For example, when you set a flag to a non-empty value that
  cannot be parsed.
  
   There are several existing errors in the stock rules that will trip
    this so you will need to clean them up before using it.
:-AI-CONTROL: Enables AI Control feature. Entering this command in the command
  line before opening Yuri's Revenge allows the player to assign a
  hotkey to allowing AI control.
  
   This feature was designed primarily for the purposes of offline
    testing and AI design testing. Due to this, feature complexity, lack of
    interest and a change in personnel, please note that this feature is NOT
    officially supported.

 Command line; Option to not require the Yuri's Revenge game disk.
 Command line; Option to not play the EA/Westwood logo video.
