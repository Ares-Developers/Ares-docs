Graphics / Surface Drawing


 This is for advanced users only!

In ares.ini you can add the following section:

::

    [Graphics.Advanced]
    DirectX.Force= (hardware|emulation)

While hardware is the default, emulation has the same effect
as the special ddraw.dll which made the games faster by not drawing
the effects that aren't supported by software emulation.

 \ emulation is not available on Windows Vista and later.
  Ares defaults to hardware on such systems.

 \ Ares.ini is not intended to be included or edited by mods,
  as this file may include various other settings in future that the end-user
  wishes to set themselves. Launch Base does not permit mods to include
  ares.ini, and also provides its own interface to allow the user to
  modify the above graphical settings.
