Compatibility Notes


RockPatch/NPatch

Ares is not intended to be used in conjunction with any third party
patch that modifies the executable of the game. Ares works by having
its code injected into Yuri's Revenge at very specific points, and
modifications to the executable change the locations of these points. This would
lead to Ares's code being injected in the wrong places, leading to
unforeseeable, bad consequences.

In case Ares detects a game version mismatch or a third party patch
known to be incompatible, it will automatically prevent Syringe to inject it
into the game.

Comodo Internet Security

Commendably, Comodo Internet Security actually complains when one
program tries to modify another at runtime, unlike other anti-virus products,
which happily let it happen. Unfortunately, this is exactly the way
Syringe/Ares works, making it a so-called "false positive".

In order for Syringe/Ares to work with Comodo Internet
Security, you have to make the following changes to Comodo's settings
(courtesy of eva-251
):

#. gamemd.exe and Syringe.exe need to be in the "Trusted Files"
   list.
#. Under "Computer Security Policy" -> "Defense+ Rules", gamemd.exe and
   Syringe.exe need to be marked as "Installer or Updater".
#. "Defense+ Settings" -> "Execution Control Settings" -> "Detect shellcode
   injections" should be checked.
#. Under "Defense+ Settings" -> "Execution Control Settings" -> "Exclusions:"
   add Syringe.exe, Ares.dll, Ares.dll.inj,
   gamemd.exe.

This should allow Syringe/Ares to work properly.

 For your own safety, do not *ever* run a Windows-computer without
	active anti-virus protection. Computer worms actively scan the Internet
	for vulnerable machines, so even if you don't do anything, you could
	be infected within minutes.

ZoneAlarm

ZoneAlarm is known to prevent Syringe/Ares from
starting. In case Yuri's Revenge does not start (Syringe
closes immediately), add gamemd.exe and Syringe.exe to the
exceptions list.

If this does not help, try to stop the service called ZoneAlarm
ForceField Service (ISWSVC.exe). This is not recommended and you
should re-enable the service as quickly as possible. Thanks to FS-21

Required Changes For Mods Using Ares

Unfortunately, Ares will not simply "work" without changes to the
original game files. The reason for this is that maintaining compatibility with
the original game files whilst still offering the enhancements that are
Ares' raison d'être would make implementing Ares features
(both for us, the developers, and you, the mod author) considerably more
complex, ultimately wasting time that would be better spent on other tasks.

This section details the modifications you'll most likely need to make to ensure
your mod does not receive any unexpected changes from simply being run whilst
Ares is active.

rulesmd.ini

Add APOCEXP to the end of the Animations list. Because
Ares doesn't automatically add types into the list when parsing tags,
the game no longer knows about this Apocalypse Tank weapon animation.

ares.mix

This new MIX file is bundled with Ares to provide any new/modified files
that Ares changes/additions rely on. This file should always be
distributed together with the other Ares files and updated whenever
Ares is updated.

Mods should include neither their own version of ares.mix nor a version
that does not belong to the respective version of Ares.
