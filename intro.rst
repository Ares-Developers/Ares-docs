Introduction
============
:game:`Ares` is the new tool to extend the capabilities of :game:`Yuri's
Revenge`. It was conceived by pd near the end of 2007, and is currently in an
early development and testing cycle.

This documentation is aimed primarily at :game:`Ares` testers, as :game:`Ares`
is a work in progress and subject to many further changes. However, the
documentation is also aimed at mod authors wishing to make use of the new
functionality that :game:`Ares` offers.

:game:`Ares` is incorporated into :game:`Yuri's Revenge` via the use of
:game:`Syringe`, a program developed by pd to 'inject' DLL code into a running
executable without modifying the executable itself. In this case, the
:game:`Ares` DLL is injected into the :game:`Yuri's Revenge` 1.001 main
executable, :file:`gamemd.exe`.

:game:`Syringe` can be run directly via a command line prompt, or automatically
using :game:`Launch Base`. See the respective documentations of those programs
for further details.
