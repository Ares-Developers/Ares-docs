Super Weapons
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

In :game:`Yuri's Revenge`, there is very little you can do to change or add to
the existing super weapons -- most super weapon-related features are hard-coded
to only work as designed for the original super weapons. Ares, however, includes
several new ways to customize existing super weapons as well as several wholly
new super weapons.

.. note:: You cannot change a super weapon's :tag:`Type=` or :tag:`Action=`
  values in any of the game mode specific INI files (like
  \ :file:`mpfreeforallmd.ini`) or map files. To achive the same effect, add a
  new super weapon to :file:`rulesmd.ini` with the different :tag:`Type=` or
  \ :tag:`Action=` and change :tag:`SuperWeapon=` for the respective owner
  buildings to use the new super weapon in the INI file instead.
