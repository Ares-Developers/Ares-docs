Building Animations
```````````````````

Buildings can display specific animations for when the attached super weapon is
charging, is nearly charged (1 minute remaining in the normal game), is ready to
be fired, and when it fires. However, in :game:`Yuri's Revenge`, these
animations only work properly for the original super weapons. In :game:`Ares`,
these will work for any super weapon.
