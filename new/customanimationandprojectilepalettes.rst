Custom Animation and Projectile Palettes
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

In *Yuri's Revenge*, you could use the animation or the unit palette to
display animations. Ares lets you to specify custom palettes for
animations and projectiles.

:[Animation]CustomPalette= (filename with .pal extension):
  Specifies the palette used to draw this animation/projectile.


You can specify theater-specific palettes by putting three ~ marks to
the theater specific part of the filename. Note that if you're using
this on projectiles, you have to add the projectile to the
`[Animations]` list.
