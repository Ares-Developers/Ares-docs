Custom Animation and Projectile Palettes
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

In :game:`Yuri's Revenge`, you could use the animation or the unit palette to
display animations. :game:`Ares` lets you to specify custom palettes for
animations and projectiles.

:[Animation]CustomPalette= (filename with .pal extension):
  Specifies the palette used to draw this animation/projectile.


You can specify theater-specific palettes by putting three ~ marks to the
theater specific part of the filename. Note that if you're using this on
projectiles, you have to add the projectile to the :tag:`[Animations]` list.
