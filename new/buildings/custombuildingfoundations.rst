Custom Building Foundations
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Building Foundations can now be any shape and size, not just the few predefined
options previously available. For example, you can now recreate the old
:game:`Red Alert` Repair Depot foundation. The INI coding is rather complex, so
instead of writing it manually, it's recommended to use the :download:`Custom
Foundation Generator </extras/custom_foundation.html>` developed by Renegade.

When creating foundations, don't forget to create the outlines.

.. note:: War Factories are hard-coded to use the unit exit paths from the
  original game so changing the foundation for these buildings is not
  recommended. The preferred exit point for a unit exiting a War Factory
  is hard-coded to be the 11th cell of the Outline.

.. note:: The Custom Foundation Generator located with the Renegade Project
  Network is incompatible with Google Chrome, and results in gibberish.
  Be advised.
