<div><div class="admonition warning">
<p class="first admonition-title">Warning</p>
<p class="last">This is for advanced users only!</p>
</div>
<p>This option was only really added for testing purposes and doesn&#8217;t really
enhance the look of the support beam so it is recommended that you ignore this
option. In the original game, the master (firing) tower enlists just one slave
(support) tower per frame. Each slave tower enlisted begins charging at that
time and the master tower restarts charging. This gives the effect of having
the slave tower beams arrive in quick succession, rather than all at once.
This effect is barely noticeable in-game except at slow speeds or if the
network has a large number of towers.</p>
<p>In <span class="game docutils literal">Ares</span>, this has been changed so that all adjacent slave towers are
enlisted on the same frame. That said, a charge delay has been introduced so
that the towers do not all appear to start charging immediately. For each
backward-chain in the network, the farthest-forward towers begin charging just
that little bit later, to give the effect of the beam travelling along the
chain. The amount that each tower will delay starting its charge for can be
specified by <span><code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">PrismForwarding.ChargeDelay</span></code></span>. This delay accumulates for
each chain in the prism forwarding network.</p>
<p>So, for example, if <span><code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">PrismForwarding.ChargeDelay=2</span></code></span> and you have a prism
chain of 3 towers then the farthest tower (tower 3) will begin charging
immediately, the middle tower (tower 2) will begin charging after 2 frames and
the firing tower (tower 1) will begin charging after a further 2 frames. All
towers will be in their charging state on the 4th frame. At firing time, the
beams will filter down from the farthest tower to the firing tower. Due to the
new way in which the actual power of the beam is transferred across the prism
forwarding network, the minimum charge delay is 1, so you cannot have the
beams all appear simultaneously. However, at normal game speeds, a charge
delay of 1 frame is barely noticeable, unless there is a particularly long
chain in the network.</p>
<p>Default charge delay is <cite>1</cite>. Increase this to have the support beams
spread across the network more slowly (not recommended, as large values tend
to lower the quality of the effect).</p>

<dl class="docutils">
<dt><span><code class="definition docutils literal"><span class="pre">[BuildingType]►PrismForwarding.Intensity=</span></code><span class="type definition"> (integer - laser thickness)</span></span></dt>
<dd><p class="first">This allows you to control how thick the laser beam grows as the size of the
prism network increases. By default, a firing Prism Tower that is supported by
1 or more other towers would have a <span><code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">LaserThickness</span></code></span> of 5 - that&#8217;s 2
higher than the default <span><code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">LaserThickness</span></code></span> of the firing weapon (3). The
<span><code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">PrismForwarding.Intensity</span></code></span> flag treats negative values as an absolute
addition to the firing beam, so the default value of <cite>-2</cite> leaves the
behavior exactly the same as the original game.</p>
<p class="last">Positive values, on the other hand, tell <span class="game docutils literal">Ares</span> that you want the
thickness of the beam to be dependent on the number of backward chains in the
network, and also have the support beam thickness increase in the same way. A
<span><code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">PrismForwarding.Intensity</span></code></span> value of 1 would cause the farthest beam to
have no thickness increase, the next to have an increase of 1, the next to
