Mechanical and Organic Warheads
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

:game:`Yuri's Revenge` was hardcoded to only allow infantry to heal other
infantry and repair vehicles to only repair other vehicles. :game:`Ares` removes
this hardcoding and now :type:`InfantryTypes` and :type:`VehicleTypes` can heal
or repair all :type:`TechnoTypes` depending on verses. This allows to create
Mechanics as known from :game:`The Aftermath` as well as Ambulances known from
:game:`Generals`.

:game:`Ares` supports the Guard Area action, which makes units follow and
protect a specific unit, as well as overriding heal by pressing the Force Move
keys, which allows units to enter damaged transporters.

.. note:: Aircraft docked on a helipad or airport cannot be repaired. This
  mimics the original behavior.
