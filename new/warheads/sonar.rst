This is the same effect as applied by the Sonar Pulse super weapon. It prevents
targeted objects from using their active cloaking abilities.

Whether this effect is applied when no conventional damage is dealt can be
customized. See :ref:`wh-effects`.

:tagdef:`[Warhead]Sonar.Duration=integer - frames`
  If set to a positive value, defines the number of frames the target unit hit
  by this warhead will not be able to cloak for. Defaults to :value:`0`.
