Radar Jammers
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

*Red Alert*-like Radar Jammers, where the mere presence of the jammmer
within a certain range of the radar causes an outage (i.e. no weapons
firing, no deploy, etc. needed), are now possible again (`Request
#305`_).
The jamming will only affect the radar functionality of the building,
no other functions.
The building will not go offline.
The jammer will only jam the radars in range; should the enemy player
have unjammed radars elsewhere on the map, he will continue to have
radar through those structures.
The jammer will not work on allied countries, including the player
himself.
Ares's jammers also jam the SpySat Uplink. Radar jammers.
