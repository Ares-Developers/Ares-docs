Loose Audio Files
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The game can now load sounds from WAV files - they no longer have to be packed
into a BAG file. Sounds should be referenced in :file:`soundmd.ini` just the
same as always (without the .wav extension).

.. index: Sounds; WAV files loose in the Red Alert 2 directory or in the MIX files can now be played, without having to include them in audio.bag.

.. versionadded:: 0.1
