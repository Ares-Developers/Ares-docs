This feature has been restored from :game:`Tiberian Sun`. It is again possible
to create a projectile that can run out of fuel and detonate in mid-air, if it
has not reached its destination by then.

The default range is about 390 cells. See :doc:`ProjectileRange
</new/weapons/projectilerange>` on how to customize it.

:tagdef:`[Projectile]Ranged=boolean`
