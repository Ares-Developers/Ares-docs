23 of 59 NPatch features are presently unique to NPatch (this is an
approximation and subject to interpretation).

53 of 86 Ares features are unique to Ares (again, this is an
approximation and subject to interpretation, however we have tried to
be strict in only counting totally unique features).
This does not count the Bug Fixes section (NPatch documentation does
not go into detail about the extent of bug fixes, if any).
