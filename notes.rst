Compatibility Notes
===================

RockPatch/NPatch
----------------
:game:`Ares` is not intended to be used in conjunction with any third party
patch that modifies the executable of the game. :game:`Ares` works by having
its code injected into :game:`Yuri's Revenge` at very specific points, and
modifications to the executable change the locations of these points. This would
lead to :game:`Ares`'s code being injected in the wrong places, leading to
unforeseeable, bad consequences.

In case :game:`Ares` detects a game version mismatch or a third party patch
known to be incompatible, it will automatically prevent Syringe to inject it
into the game.

Comodo Internet Security
------------------------
Commendably, :game:`Comodo Internet Security` actually complains when one
program tries to modify another at runtime, unlike other anti-virus products,
which happily let it happen. Unfortunately, this is exactly the way
:game:`Syringe`/:game:`Ares` works, making it a so-called "false positive".

In order for :game:`Syringe`/:game:`Ares` to work with :game:`Comodo Internet
Security`, you have to make the following changes to Comodo's settings
(`courtesy of eva-251
<http://forums.renegadeprojects.com/showthread.php?tid=1714&pid=17592#pid17592>`_):

#. :file:`gamemd.exe` and :file:`Syringe.exe` need to be in the "Trusted Files"
   list.
#. Under "Computer Security Policy" -> "Defense+ Rules", :file:`gamemd.exe` and
   :file:`Syringe.exe` need to be marked as "Installer or Updater".
#. "Defense+ Settings" -> "Execution Control Settings" -> "Detect shellcode
   injections" should be checked.
#. Under "Defense+ Settings" -> "Execution Control Settings" -> "Exclusions:"
   add :file:`Syringe.exe`, :file:`Ares.dll`, :file:`Ares.dll.inj`,
   :file:`gamemd.exe`.

This should allow :game:`Syringe`/:game:`Ares` to work properly.

.. warning:: For your own safety, do not *ever* run a Windows-computer without
	active anti-virus protection. Computer worms actively scan the Internet
	for vulnerable machines, so even if you don't do anything, you could
	be infected within minutes.

ZoneAlarm
---------
:game:`ZoneAlarm` is known to prevent :game:`Syringe`/:game:`Ares` from
starting. In case :game:`Yuri's Revenge` does not start (:game:`Syringe`
closes immediately), add :file:`gamemd.exe` and :file:`Syringe.exe` to the
exceptions list.

If this does not help, try to stop the service called :game:`ZoneAlarm
ForceField Service` (:file:`ISWSVC.exe`). This is not recommended and you
should re-enable the service as quickly as possible. `Thanks to FS-21

Required Changes For Mods Using Ares
====================================
Unfortunately, :game:`Ares` will not simply "work" without changes to the
original game files. The reason for this is that maintaining compatibility with
the original game files whilst still offering the enhancements that are
:game:`Ares`' raison d'Ãªtre would make implementing :game:`Ares` features
(both for us, the developers, and you, the mod author) considerably more
complex, ultimately wasting time that would be better spent on other tasks.

This section details the modifications you'll most likely need to make to ensure
your mod does not receive any unexpected changes from simply being run whilst
:game:`Ares` is active.

rulesmd.ini
-----------
Add :value:`APOCEXP` to the end of the :type:`Animations` list. Because
:game:`Ares` doesn't automatically add types into the list when parsing tags,
the game no longer knows about this Apocalypse Tank weapon animation.

artmd.ini
---------
:tag:`[TELE]SecondaryFireFLH=85,0,130`
	See :doc:`/bugfixes/type2/radbeamsandwavesusingthewrongflh`.

bombcurs.shp
------------
The :file:`bombcurs.shp` animation needs to have its last frame removed if you
don't want to see the previously unused skull image. See
:ref:`IvanBomb.FlickerRate <custom-ivan-bombs>`.

ares.mix
--------
Mods should not include their own version of :file:`ares.mix`. This new MIX file
is bundled with :game:`Ares` to provide any new/modified files that :game:`Ares`
changes/additions rely on. This MIX file presently includes:

:file:`ares.csf` includes a few new strings:

+ `GUI:SelectCampaign=Select your Campaign`
+ `GUI:PlayMission=Play`
+ `GUI:UrbanAreas=Create Urban Areas`
+ `Name:Desert=Desert`
+ `STT:RMGUrbanAreas=Choose whether urban areas will be present on the map.`
+ `STT:MultiEngineer=Engineers can capture damaged buildings only.`
+ `STT:PlayerColorLilac=Choose this to be lilac.`
+ `STT:PlayerColorLightBlue=Choose this to be light blue.`
+ `STT:PlayerColorLime=Choose this to be lime.`
+ `STT:PlayerColorTeal=Choose this to be teal.`
+ `STT:PlayerColorBrown=Choose this to be brown.`
+ `STT:PlayerColorCharcoal=Choose this to be dark grey.`
+ `TXT_COMMAND_DISABLED=The %s command is not available.`
+ `TXT_RELEASE_NOTE=` (empty text)
+ `TXT_SCRNCAP_DESC=Take a snapshot of the game screen. (Saved as
  'SCRN.date-time.BMP' file in Red Alert 2 run directory.)`
+ `TXT_RELEASE=Launch`
+ `TXT_FAKE=Fake`
