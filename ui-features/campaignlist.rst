Campaign List
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If you have more campaigns than the game's default Campaign Selection
menu supports you can switch to a campaign list as in Tiberian Sun.
Ares supports an arbitrary amout of campaigns. Every non-debug battle
listed in battlemd.ini will show up in the list under the name defined
by `Description=`. Campaign List.



Enable the campaign list in uimd.ini:

:[UISettings]CampaignList= (boolean): Enables the campaign list
  instead of the game's default menu. CampaignList=
:[UISettings]ShowDebugCampaigns= (boolean): Also displays campaigns in
  the list that have `DebugOnly=yes` set. ShowDebugCampaigns=


You can customize the campaigns in the list by editing battlemd.ini:

:[Battle]HoverSound= (sound): The sound to be played when the player
  selects a campaign. This defaults to `AlliedCampaignSelect`,
  `SovietCampaignSelect`, and `BootCampSelect` for the original in-game
  campaigns. The selection menu plays them if the mouse hovers over the
  respective campaign's image. HoverSound=
:[Battle]Summary= (CSF label): Provide an optional summary about the
  story of the campaign. It will be shown below the difficulty slider.
