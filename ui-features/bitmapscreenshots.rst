Bitmap Screenshots
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

With :game:`Ares` active, screenshots are now generated as BMP files rather than
PCX. BMP files are smaller in size and are more widely supported.

.. note:: The BMP files are written in reverse line order. This is perfectly
  valid but some graphics editors may not support it.

The screenshot function now generates timestamped filenames instead of
sequential ones, to avoid progressively longer delays as the output directory
gets full.

.. index:: Screenshots saved as BMP files rather than PCX.

.. versionadded:: 0.1
