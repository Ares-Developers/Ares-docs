Bitmap Screenshots
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

With Ares active, screenshots are now generated as BMP files rather
than PCX. BMP files are smaller in size and are more widely supported.
NB:The BMP files are written in reverse line order. This is perfectly
valid but some graphics editors may not support it. Screenshots saved
as BMP files rather than PCX.
