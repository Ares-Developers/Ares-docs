:captiontag:`NoSpawnAlt` and :captiontag:`Temporal` Warheads
============================================================

:tag:`NoSpawnAlt=yes` units always displayed their spawn-less body voxel when
attacked by :tag:`Temporal` weapons: When a Chrono Legionnaire attacked a
Destroyer, its docked Osprey would disappear the moment the vessel froze. This
does not happen any more and spawner units will now always use the body voxel
displaying their proper state.
