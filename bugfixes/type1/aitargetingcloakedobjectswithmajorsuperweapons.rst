AI Targeting Cloaked Objects With Major Super Weapons
`````````````````````````````````````````````````````

When AI controlled Super weapons with `Type=WeatherStorm` or
`Type=Nuke` picked their target, they failed to ignore cloaked objects
(such as Submarines) and, as a result, sometimes selected them as
targets, ruining the appearance of fair play. Cloaked objects are no
longer considered as targets for these super weapons. AI will not use
weather storms or nukes on cloaked units.
