AI Targeting Cloaked Objects With Major Super Weapons
=====================================================

When AI controlled super weapons with :tag:`Type=LightningStorm`,
:tag:`Type=MultiMissile`, :tag:`Type=PsychicDominator`, and
:tag:`Type=GeneticConverter` picked their target, they failed to ignore cloaked
objects (such as Submarines) and, as a result, sometimes selected them as
targets, ruining the appearance of fair play. Cloaked objects are no longer
considered as targets for these super weapons.
