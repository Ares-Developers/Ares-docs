Chronoshift Will Sink Jumpjet Units
===================================

If a jumpjet unit with :tag:`SpeedType=Hover` like the Nighthawk or the deployed
Siege Chopper was chronoshifted into water it originally would not sink. The
unit would even be able to take off unharmed. :game:`Ares` will let these
jumpjet units sink.
