.. index:: Secret Labs; Too many secret labs on a map would cause them all to be empty. Not anymore.

====================
Too Many Secret Labs
====================

If there were more Secret Labs on the map than there were possible boons then
all of the Secret Labs would be 'empty'. This has been fixed such that every
Secret Lab will pick its boon completely at random, independently of other
Secret Labs on the map.
