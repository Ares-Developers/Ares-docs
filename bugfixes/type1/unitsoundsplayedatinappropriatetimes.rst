Unit Sounds Played At Inappropriate Times
`````````````````````````````````````````

When a unit was pulled by a Magnetron it would play its `MoveSound`,
even though it was not moving under its own power. Now, this sound
will only be played when the unit moves under its own power. Units
pulled by a Magnetron will on longer play their move sound.
