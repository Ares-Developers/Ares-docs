==================================================
Occupiers Are Promoted Only After Exiting Building
==================================================

Infantry could gain experience killing enemies while occupying a structure, but
unlike units in :tag:`OpenTopped` vehicles (and with :game:`Ares` with
:tag:`Gunner` vehicles also), occupiers are not promoted immediately. They had
to exit the building first, and only after doing this would they use the elite
weapon when occupying a structure again.

With :game:`Ares`, the promotion now happens immediately and without exiting,
but it is silent, that is, no sound will play.
