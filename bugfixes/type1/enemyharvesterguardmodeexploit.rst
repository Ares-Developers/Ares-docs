Enemy Harvester Guard Mode Exploit
``````````````````````````````````

It was possible to issue the 'guard mode' order to enemy harvesters as
if they were your own units. Players unaware of this exploit would
find their economy crippled when facing an unscrupulous player. It is
no longer possible to issue the guard mode order to enemy harvesters.
