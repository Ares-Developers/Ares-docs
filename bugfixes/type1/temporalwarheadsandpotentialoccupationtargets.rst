Temporal Warheads and Potential Occupation Targets
``````````````````````````````````````````````````

building was erased with a Temporal warhead before the potential
occupiers could arrive, an Internal Error would occur. Ares fixes this
behavior so that erasing the structure will no longer trigger an
error. Temporal Warheads and potential occupation targets.
