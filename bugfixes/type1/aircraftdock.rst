.. index:: Aircraft; Players can again manually select an aircraft's dock.

=============================================
Aircraft Can Be Manually Docked to Structures
=============================================

Players were not allowed to manually select which structure aircraft was docked
to in :game:`Yuri's Revenge`. This has been fixed and players can land aircraft
on any structure that is in the :type:`AircraftType`'s :tag:`Dock` list.

The mouse will now show either the enter or no-enter cursor if a structure is in
:tag:`Dock`, otherwise the select cursor is used.
