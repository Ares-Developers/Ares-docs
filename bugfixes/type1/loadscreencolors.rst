Load Screen Colors
``````````````````

Westwood did not update the code that selects the load screen text
color for Yuri's Revenge. The original campaigns always used red no
matter what faction you played as. For the multiplayer game modes,
everything that was not Allied got red, too. Ares selects these
values: Allies get blue for campaigns and Yuri gets purple in
multiplayer. Dedicated load screen text colors for each faction.
