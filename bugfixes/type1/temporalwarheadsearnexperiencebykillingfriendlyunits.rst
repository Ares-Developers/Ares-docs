:captiontag:`Temporal` Warheads Earn Experience By Killing Friendly Units
=========================================================================

When a unit kills an enemy unit it gains experience, which can lead to that unit
becoming veteran or elite. Killing friendly units (your own or your allies')
does not earn experience in this way.

However, *Temporal* warheads (warheads with :tag:`Temporal=yes` set) *did* use
to earn experience when killing friendly units. This is no longer the case.
