.. index:: Walls;  Walls remap to the owning player's colour.

================
Remappable Walls
================

Walls (i.e. OverlayTypes with ``Wall=yes``) always use the same colour
in place of the remap for all players, regardless of the owning
player's colour. Ares will instead draw walls' remappable sections in
their respective owner's colours.
