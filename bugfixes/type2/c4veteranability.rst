  Veterancy; C4 Veteran Ability restored

===========================
:value:`C4` Veteran Ability
===========================

The :value:`C4` veteran ability did not work correctly in :game:`Red Alert 2`
and :game:`Yuri's Revenge`. Even though infantry could be ordered to use the C4
gained through veterancy, it could not blow up buildings. This has been fixed
and the ability now works as it did in :game:`Tiberian Sun`.

.. versionadded:: 0.5
