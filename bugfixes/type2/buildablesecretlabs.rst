Buildable Secret Labs
`````````````````````

Secret Lab boons were picked on map load so if a Secret Lab were not
pre-placed on the map then it would not provide a boon. With Ares,
Secret Labs constructed by a player will randomly pick a boon that
that player could not build at the time the Secret Lab was placed.
Buildable secret labs will now have a boon.
