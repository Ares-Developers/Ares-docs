Amphibious Objects Sink When Chronoshifted Onto Water
=====================================================

When an amphibious (not hover) object - that is, one that can normally
enter water cells without problem - was chronoshifted onto water by
the Chrono Sphere, it would sink. Ares corrects this so that all
amphibious objects can be chronoshifted onto water without sinking.
