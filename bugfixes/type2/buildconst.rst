.. index:: EVA; EVA will always announce Low Power now unrelated to [AI]>BuildConst.

==========
BuildConst
==========

If you get into low power then the EVA will announce 'low power', but
only if you have one of the first 3 buildings from the
``[AI]`` |>| ``BuildConst`` list. With Ares, you'll get the EVA announcement if
you have any building from the list. "Low power" announcement used to
occur only if you owned one of the first 3 buildings from
``BuildConst``. This now works if you have any building on the list.
