  Sides; EVA will always announce Low Power now unrelated to BuildConst
  EVA; Low Power announcement plays not just for the first three sides

========================
:captiontag:`BuildConst`
========================

If you get into low power then the EVA will announce 'low power', but only if
you have one of the first 3 buildings from the :tag:`[AI]BuildConst` list. With
:game:`Ares`, you'll get the EVA announcement if you have any building from the
list.
