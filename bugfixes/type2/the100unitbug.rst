The 100-Unit Bug
================

There is no longer an upper limit on the InfantryTypes, VehicleTypes
and AircraftTypes lists.

NB: The so-called Whiteboy Bug (where graphical glitches and even game
freezing can occur when there are 74 or more cameos visible on the
sidebar at the same time) has not been fixed.

.. versionadded:: 0.1
