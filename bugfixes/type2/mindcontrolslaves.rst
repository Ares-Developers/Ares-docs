.. index:: Slaves; Slaves change ownership if their enslaving unit does.

==================================================
Slaves Change Ownership If Enslaver Switches Sides
==================================================

In :game:`Yuri's Revenge` the Slave Miner was the only unit that enslaved
:type:`InfantryTypes`, and it was immune to mind-control and couldn't be
captured. If it could be captured however, you would notice the slaves wouldn't
change their ownership along with the vehicle - they would stay on the original
owner's side.

In :game:`Ares`, slaves will also change their ownership if their enslaving unit
is captured or mind-controlled.
