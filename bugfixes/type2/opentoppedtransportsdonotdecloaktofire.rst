:captiontag:`OpenTopped` Transports Do Not Decloak To Fire
==========================================================

If a passenger inside an 'open topped' vehicle (e.g. the Battle Fortress) fired
a weapon with :tag:`DecloakToFire=yes` set then the open topped vehicle (if it
were cloaked) would not decloak when the weapon was fired. Now it will.
