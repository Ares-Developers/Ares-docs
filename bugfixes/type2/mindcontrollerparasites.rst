Mind-Controller Parasites
`````````````````````````

MC-parasites would draw a mind-control link between the mind-
controlled unit and the point on the map where the parasite entered
the unit. Now the link will not be drawn at all. You can also use
MindControl.Permanent instead, in order to use the perma-mc animation.
Mind-controller parasites will no longer draw the mind-control link
when the the target is selected.
