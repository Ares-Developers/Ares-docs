.. index:: Super Weapons; Nuke super weapons can be overridden to use a sound other than DigSound for their siren.

======================
:captiontag:`DigSound`
======================

:tag:`[AudioVisual]DigSound` is used for both the global Nuke siren and the
sound made when a subterranean unit (with
:tag:`Locomotor={4A582743-9839-11d1-B709-00A024DDAFD1}`) digs into or emerges
from the ground. With :game:`Ares`, the super weapon can specify its own
:tag:`SW.ActivationSound` (which defaults to :tag:`[AudioVisual]DigSound`
for nukes).
