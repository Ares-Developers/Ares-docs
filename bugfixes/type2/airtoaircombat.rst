.. index:: Aircraft; Attack other aircraft if given a weapon with an AA=yes projectile

=================
Air-To-Air Combat
=================

Anti-air weapons (where the projectile has :tag:`AA=yes` set) could not be used
by :type:`AircraftTypes` -- aircraft simply would not attack other airborne
units. Now, anti-air weapons work just fine on aircraft. No additional flags are
required.
