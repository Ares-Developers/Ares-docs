Air-To-Air Combat
`````````````````

Anti-air weapons (where the projectile has `AA=yes` set) could not be
used by AircraftTypes aircraft simply would not attack other airborne
units. Now, anti-air weapons work just fine on aircraft. No additional
flags are required. Aircraft can now attack other aircraft if given a
weapon with an `AA=yes` projectile.
