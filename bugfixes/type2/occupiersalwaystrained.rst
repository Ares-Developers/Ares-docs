.. index:: Veterancy; Occupiers with Trainable=no are no longer trained.

===============================================================
Occupiers are always trained even if :captiontag:`Trainable=no`
===============================================================

Units occupying civilian structures or Battle Bunkers unconditionally gain
experience from kills even if :tag:`Trainable=no` is set. In the original game,
GIs, Conscipts and Initiates are all :tag:`Trainable=yes`, and thus the problem
does not arise. :game:`Ares` fixes this.
