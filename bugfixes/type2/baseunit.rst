.. index:: Sides; BaseUnit can now hold more than 3 vehicles

======================
:captiontag:`BaseUnit`
======================

:tag:`[General]BaseUnit` specifies the list of :type:`VehicleTypes` that are
considered to be MCVs. Only the first 3 entries of this list were recognized by
the game, which means that additional sides would never be playable in non-Short
Games (among other limitations). :game:`Ares` removes this limit so all entries
in the list are now recognized.
