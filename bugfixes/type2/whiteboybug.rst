The Whiteboy Bug
================

There is no longer an upper limit of 74 on the number of buildings, units and
superweapons that can be displayed per construction tab on the UI bar. The game
will no longer freeze or even crash when this static limit is exceeded. This
bug is known as `Whiteboy bug <https://bugs.launchpad.net/ares/+bug/896028>`_.
