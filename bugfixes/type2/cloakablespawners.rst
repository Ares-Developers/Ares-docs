.. index:: Cloak; Spawner units can be cloakable.

==================
Cloakable Spawners
==================

The moment a :tag:`Spawner=yes` unit cloaked, all spawns would be destroyed and
had to respawn, because the spawns did not differentiate between a carrier going
out out sight or being destroyed.

:game:`Ares` changes this and it is now possible to have cloakable Aircraft
Carriers or Destroyers. Spawned aircraft will not crash when the spawning unit
cloaks.
